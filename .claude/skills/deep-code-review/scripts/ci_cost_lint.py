"""ci_cost_lint.py — flag GitHub Actions workflows that waste CI runner minutes.

WHY THIS EXISTS
----------------
A fleet of agents pushing branches burns runner minutes fast: duplicate runs
(push AND pull_request firing on the same commits), no cancel-in-progress (a
stale run keeps burning while a newer push already superseded it), no
timeout-minutes (a hung job burns its whole default budget), an over-frequent
schedule, an oversized build matrix, or a workflow that reruns on every
docs-only edit. This lint flags each lever with the concrete fix; it never
edits a workflow itself.

WHAT IT PARSES
---------------
A minimal, stdlib-only YAML SUBSET — no PyYAML dependency (this repo's own CI
has no `pip install` step, so a PyYAML import cannot be relied on to exist).
Supports block mappings, block sequences (`- item` and `- key: value`), flow
sequences/maps (`[a, b]`, `{a: b}`) closed on one line, quoted/bare scalars,
and comments; block scalars (`key: |` / `key: >`) are recognized and their
body skipped (this lint never needs literal step-script text, only
structural keys). This is NOT a general YAML parser: anchors (`&name`),
aliases (`*name`), a flow collection split across multiple lines, and a
second `---` document-start marker (multi-document YAML) are all explicitly
unsupported and RAISE rather than being silently mis-parsed. Two structural
invariants are enforced the same way: the top-level parse must consume every
line (leftover lines mean the indentation didn't resolve the way this
subset's block parser expects), and a plain scalar value can never be
followed by a more-deeply-indented line (that shape is either a multi-line
plain scalar, which this subset does not fold, or invalid indentation).
Any of these raises `UnsupportedYAML`, caught once per file and reported as
a single PARSE-ERROR finding (non-advisory, so it exits non-zero under
`--gate`) — fails closed: never silently skipped, never crashes the scan.

CHECKS (one line per finding, name + fix)
-------------------------------------------
1. CONCURRENCY   — a `pull_request`-triggered workflow with no top-level
   `concurrency:` carrying a truthy `cancel-in-progress`. A superseded push
   keeps its old run burning instead of being canceled.
2. TIMEOUT       — a job with no `timeout-minutes`. GitHub applies its own
   large default ceiling per job when unset (verify the current number on
   GitHub's docs before citing it as fixed), so a hang burns most of that
   budget before GitHub itself intervenes.
3. DUP-TRIGGER   — both `push` (to the default branch) and `pull_request`
   trigger the same workflow while required-status-checks are STRICT (branch
   must be up to date before merge) — the push-after-merge re-runs what the
   PR already ran. Strictness is read via `--repo` (a live `gh api` call) or
   asserted with `--strict-protection`; with neither, this prints as an
   ADVISORY line (never blocks `--gate`) because the lint cannot tell.
4. SCHEDULE      — a `schedule:` cron whose minute field is not a single
   fixed value (i.e. `*`, a list, or a step) fires more than once an hour.
5. MATRIX-SIZE   — a job's `strategy.matrix` combinatorial size (product of
   its list-valued axes, `include`/`exclude` excluded) exceeds `--matrix-max`
   (default 6).
6. PATHS-FILTER  — (always ADVISORY, never blocks `--gate`) a workflow whose
   steps look test-only (a `pytest`/`go test`/`npm test`/… signal) but whose
   `push`/`pull_request` trigger has no `paths`/`paths-ignore`, so a docs-only
   change still runs it.
7. PUSH-TRIGGER  — any `push:` trigger at all. The minimum-cost profile
   (`agentic-delivery/references/host-enforcement.md`) bans push-triggered
   hosted CI outright: an integration branch gets zero hosted CI, and
   main/release CI runs only on a PR. Suppressed to ADVISORY on a file
   carrying a `# ci-cost: allow <reason>` comment anywhere in it.
8. INTEGRATION-PR-BRANCH — a `pull_request` or `pull_request_target` trigger
   not safely scoped to the default branch (`--default-branch`, `main`, or
   `master`): a bare trigger with no `branches`/`branches-ignore` key at all
   (matches a PR into ANY branch), a `branches-ignore` filter (excludes
   rather than restricts, so it still matches a non-default branch), or a
   `branches:` list naming one — each is hosted CI reachable from an
   integration branch, which the profile bans. Same allow-list suppression
   as PUSH-TRIGGER.
9. REQUIRED-PATHS-FILTER — (only checked when `--required` names this file)
   a required check's own trigger carries a `paths`/`paths-ignore` filter —
   an unmatched change means the check never reports and the PR blocks
   forever waiting on a status that will never arrive.
10. WEEKLY-SCHEDULE — a `schedule:` cron that fires more often than once a
    week (the profile's cap for probes). Broader than SCHEDULE (check 4,
    hourly): counts the hour field alongside day-of-month/day-of-week, so a
    daily cron (`0 2 * * *`), an hour-spanning cron pinned to one weekday
    (`0 * * * 0`, 24x that day), and a day-of-month step (`0 0 */2 * *`,
    every other day) are all caught even though none fires more than once
    an hour.
11. CONSOLIDATION — (always ADVISORY, never blocks `--gate`) two or more
    workflow files share byte-identical normalized triggers — a candidate to
    merge into one workflow (job-count rounding, see domain-k.md).

EXIT CODES
-----------
Default mode prints every finding and exits 0 (advisory only — see the repo
CLAUDE.md owner priority: informational by default, enforced only when a repo
opts in). `--gate` exits 1 if any BLOCKING finding fired (checks 1, 2, 4, 5,
7, 8, 9, 10, a PARSE-ERROR, and check 3 only when strictness is actually
known) — an ADVISORY finding (check 6, check 11, an allow-listed 7/8, or
check 3 with unknown strictness) never trips `--gate`. Exit 2 (fail closed,
not "no findings") if `root` itself does not exist; a root that exists but
has no `.github/workflows/` is a legitimate clean scan (exit 0, no findings).
`--selftest` runs the built-in RED/GREEN cases and ignores all other args.
