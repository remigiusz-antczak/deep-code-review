"""fix_class_gate.py — every fix commit must touch a pinned test, or say why not.

WHY THIS EXISTS (the failure it closes)
----------------------------------------
A bug gets "fixed" one reported case at a time — four, five, six commits in a
row, same shape, no regression test ever pinned — so the bug class keeps
resurfacing under a new input each time. This tool enforces one narrow,
mechanical precondition on every `fix:`-labeled commit in a range: it must add
or modify at least one path on a documented test surface, or it must carry a
`No-Test-Reason:` trailer explaining why it doesn't. Nothing more.

HONESTY (read this before wiring it into CI or citing it in a report)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
This gate verifies ONLY that a fix commit touched a test-surface path or
declared why not. It does NOT and CANNOT verify that the test actually pins
the whole bug class rather than the one reported case — that a fix scoped to
an enumerated list is judged against that list, and a green test proves
non-regression of the named cases, not completeness against the rest of the
tree, stays the reviewer's job (see `references/method.md`, class-discipline
passage). Any claim that this tool "enforces whole-class fixes" is a
fabrication. The accurate claim is: it enforces a pinned test per fix.

MERGE COMMITS ARE NOT CHECKED IN DEFAULT MODE (known bypass). The default
(fix-subject) range walk uses `git rev-list --no-merges`, so every merge
commit is skipped — even one whose subject is `fix:`. A so-called evil merge
(a merge commit that carries its own code change beyond resolving the two
parents) can therefore introduce an untested fix and default mode will not
see it. If that matters for a repo, forbid code changes in merge commits by
policy/review, or squash/rebase instead of merging. Trigger mode (below) DOES
evaluate merge commits, by their own changes.

WHAT COUNTS AS A "FIX" COMMIT
------------------------------
The commit subject matches, case-sensitively on the literal `fix`:
    ^fix(\\([^)]*\\))?!?:
i.e. `fix:`, `fix(scope):`, `fix!:`, `fix(scope)!:`. This is Conventional
Commits' `fix` type, including its optional scope and breaking-change `!`.
It deliberately does NOT match `fixture:`, `fixes:`, or any subject where
`fix` is not immediately followed by `(`, `!`, or `:` — those are not the
Conventional Commits `fix` type and are silently ignored (not a failure).

WHAT COUNTS AS "TOUCHING A TEST SURFACE"
------------------------------------------
The commit's diff (`git diff-tree --name-status`) has at least one path that
is ADDED, MODIFIED, RENAMED, or COPIED (never a DELETE-only path — deleting a
test file is not adding coverage) whose new/current path matches one of the
`--test-glob` patterns. Glob syntax: `*` matches within one path segment,
`**` matches across segments (including zero), `?` matches one character.
Default globs (used only when `--test-glob` is never passed; passing any
`--test-glob` REPLACES the defaults, it does not add to them):
    tests/**  test/**  **/*_test.*  **/*.test.*  **/*.spec.*
    **/test_*.py  spec/**  **/evals/*.json

THE `No-Test-Reason` ESCAPE HATCH
------------------------------------
A fix commit with no test-surface touch still PASSES if its trailer block
carries `No-Test-Reason: <non-empty text>` (read via
`git log --format=%(trailers:key=No-Test-Reason,valueonly)`, so folded/
multi-line trailer values are honored the same way `git interpret-trailers`
would resolve them). A present-but-empty trailer (`No-Test-Reason:` with
nothing after it, or only whitespace) does NOT exempt the commit — the point
is a stated reason, not a magic keyword.

TRIGGER MODE (`--trigger-glob`, the lesson-to-mechanism gate)
----------------------------------------------------------------
Passing `--trigger-glob GLOB` (repeatable) switches WHICH commits are in
scope and WHICH trailer exempts them; everything else (test-surface
matching, fail-closed exits) is shared. In trigger mode a
commit is in scope iff it ADDS, MODIFIES, RENAMES, or COPIES a path matching
a trigger glob (deleting a trigger path alone does not trigger — removing
prose adds no lesson); its subject is ignored. Two refinements:
  - Merge commits are walked, and judged by their OWN changes: the diff from
    `git merge-tree --write-tree <p1> <p2>` (the clean automatic merge of
    the two parents) to the merge commit. A clean merge that adds nothing
    has no changes and is out of scope; an evil merge that adds prose is in
    scope. When that result is unavailable (git older than 2.38, a
    conflicted merge, an octopus merge, unrelated histories) the merge's
    diff against its FIRST parent is used instead — fail closed, a merge is
    never skipped. `merge-tree --write-tree` writes the merged tree into the
    object database (no ref, no worktree change).
  - A version-stamp-only edit is not a trigger: when every changed trigger
    path is a `SKILL.md` whose only changed lines (added and removed) are
    frontmatter `version:` lines (`version: "1.2.3"`), the commit files no
    lesson (a release bumps several stamps at once) and is out of scope. One
    changed line of anything else, or a `version:` line outside the
    frontmatter, keeps it in scope.
An in-scope commit passes iff
it also touches a `--test-glob` path that does NOT itself match a trigger
glob (a path on both lists never satisfies itself — otherwise a trigger edit
would be its own mechanism), or carries a non-empty `No-Mechanism-Reason:`
trailer (same empty-value rule as `No-Test-Reason`). The intended use: every
commit that files a lesson as prose (a SKILL.md or reference edit) must land
an executable mechanism beside it (an eval, a gate script, a selftest) or
state why not. Same honesty limit as above: it proves a mechanism path was
touched, never that the mechanism pins the lesson. Without `--trigger-glob`
the default mode (fix-subject trigger + `No-Test-Reason`) is unchanged.

EXIT CODES (fail-closed; every branch below is load-bearing)
---------------------------------------------------------------
  0  every in-scope commit (fix, or trigger in trigger mode) passed
     (touched a test surface or was exempted by a non-empty
     `No-Test-Reason` / `No-Mechanism-Reason` trailer), including the
     legitimately-empty case of zero commits in range. In default mode
     merge commits are never counted (see above), so a range whose only fix
     is a merge commit also exits 0; trigger mode counts them.
  1  at least one in-scope commit failed; each is printed as its own FAIL line.
  2  FAIL CLOSED — the range could not be evaluated at all, never a silent
     pass: not a git repository; an empty `--trigger-glob` (it would match
     nothing and pass silently); `--base`/`--head` unresolvable; `--base` is
     the all-zeros SHA (the value CI hands a brand-new branch push — pass the
     PR base ref or a computed merge-base instead); or the range itself
     could not be walked (a real git error, e.g. an unrelated/unreachable
     history). An empty-but-resolvable range (base and head are the same
     commit) is distinct from all of this and exits 0 with an explicit
     `0 commits in range` line.
