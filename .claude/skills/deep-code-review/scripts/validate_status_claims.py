"""Flag a completion status that carries a caveat — "a ✅ that needs an asterisk is a ✗".

A heuristic lint for a review's status table / status lines (deep-code-review
Phase 5; see report-format.md). It surfaces CANDIDATE lines where a positive
completion status (✅ / done / exact / matches / verified / complete) co-occurs
with a hedge (if / only / once / after / unless / requires / except / assuming /
caveat / mostly / but see …) and no downgrade marker (⚠️ / ❌ / ✗ / partial /
blocked / unverified) — i.e. a claim that is only true after a non-default action,
reported green.

A second detector (issue #192) flags a positive status whose row also carries
parity vocabulary (parity / renders / restyled / screen / "matches the design" …)
yet names NO verification surface — no URL / port and no rendered sha. When more
than one tree can serve the app, a parity claim that names no surface is INVALID
(there is nothing to downgrade): it may be true about the author's tree yet false
on every surface a human opens, so this detector fires even on a ⚠️-downgraded row.
The sha test requires >= 7 hex chars with both a hex letter and a digit (so neither
a hex-looking word nor a plain number passes as a commit).

A third detector (issue #198) flags a positive status that leans on a screenshot
(screenshot / screen capture / .png) yet names none of the pixel-defect checklist
STEMS (overlap / clip / truncat / intersect / contrast / disabl / bbox / geometr) — a
screenshot proves a render happened, not that the render is correct. It fires even on
a ⚠️-downgraded row; the discriminator is the inspection stem, matched as a substring
so an inflected citation ("nothing overlapping / clipped") still exempts. That
substring match will also exempt a row that mentions "disabled"/"contrast" for an
unrelated reason — the acceptable direction for an exemption set (under-flag, never a
false alarm on a genuine inspection).

A fourth detector (issue #200) flags a positive parity claim carrying a population
quantifier (all / every / whole / "the product" / "the app" / "all pages") but no N/M
coverage fraction — a sample generalized to the whole product. It requires a
parity-context word (so "all tests pass" is spared) and fires even on a ⚠️-downgraded
row; the discriminator is the coverage fraction ("1/6", "1 of 6"), not the marker.

It is an aid to human judgement, not a proof. It can over-flag a prose line that
merely contains both a status word and a conditional; a flagged line is a lead to
re-check — downgrade to partial/blocked with the condition as the headline, or
split into a scoped two-status verdict — never an automatic defect. Run it on the
status table, not the whole report, for the least noise.

It also UNDER-flags — a clean exit is never proof the claims are true, only that
no listed pattern matched. Known false negatives:
  * it scans one physical line at a time, so a status and its hedge on different
    (wrapped) lines are missed — keep each status row on a single line;
  * the downgrade suppressor is line-global, so a downgrade word used in prose
    ("no partial coverage") can silence a genuine hedged-green on that line;
  * the token lists are fixed — a completion or hedge word not listed slips past.

Exit 0 = no candidate lines (none of the four detectors fired), 1 = candidate(s)
found, 2 = usage/unreadable.
Stdlib only. Reports line numbers + the tokens matched, not full line content.
