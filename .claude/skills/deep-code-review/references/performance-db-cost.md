# Performance, database & cost review

Read this when the target has a database, makes external/API/LLM calls, runs
batch jobs, or has any hot path where latency or spend matters. Expands section
E of `SKILL.md`. The lens is two-sided: **is it fast enough, and does each unit
of work earn its keep?**

---

## Algorithmic

- No accidental O(n²)+ on a hot path (nested scans over the same collection,
  `list.contains` in a loop, repeated sort). Right structure: set/map for
  membership and lookup, not a linear scan.
- Compute-once: hoist invariant work out of loops; memoize pure results with a
  correct key; don't recompute what you already have.
- Bound the work: an operation whose cost scales with untrusted input needs a
  cap (page size, max depth, max iterations).
- **False-positive twin of the O(n²) rule: don't flag a nested scan over a
  *bounded, config-scale* collection — reserve the finding for *unbounded /
  request-scale* growth.** The shape that triggers the rule (nested loop,
  `list.contains` in a loop) is a cost only when **n grows**. Over a collection
  whose maximum size is fixed at build time — a dozen supported currencies, a
  handful of feature flags, a fixed enum, a table's columns — n² is a *small
  constant × small constant*: no growth term, no measurable cost, and a set/map
  rewrite is churn with no win. The false positive fires when a shape-only pass
  (or a `for`-in-`for` grep) pattern-matches "quadratic!" without asking **what
  bounds n**. Before filing it, trace the collection's maximum size to its
  *source*: bounded by config / enum / schema / a hard cap → **not a finding**;
  scales with request input, dataset size, or an attacker-controlled count → a
  real finding (and, when the count is attacker-controlled, also a DoS lever —
  cross-ref *Bound the work* above and the API4 response-size axis in
  `security-appsec.md`). Only the unbounded case earns the set/map rewrite.

## Database

- **N+1**: a query issued per row of a previous result (query inside a `for`/
  `map`/serializer). Detect by reading the data-access path and by counting
  queries per request in a test. Fix with a join, an `IN (…)` batch, or the
  ORM's eager-load. A **GraphQL resolver** N+1 is the *structural* variant this
  textual grep misses: a field resolver invoked once per parent node in a list
  fires N nested fetches with **no loop visible at any single call site** — the
  fix is a per-request batch/cache seam (the **DataLoader** pattern), and the same
  queries-per-request test catches it.
- **Serialized single-row write per item of an input collection — an N+1 on the
  *write* side that survives a missing-`await` scan because every write *is*
  awaited.** A handler that persists an incoming batch with a per-item write in a
  loop — `for (const x of items) await db.insertOne(x)` (or `.save`/`.create`/
  `.update`/`execute("INSERT …")`), common in ingest / import / webhook / fan-out
  / sync helpers — issues **one network round-trip per item**: N items pay N times
  the write latency, serially, so throughput collapses and a large batch times
  out. Every line is individually correct — the promise is awaited, so a
  floating-promise / no-`await` lint sees nothing — and no *prior query result* is
  being looped, so the read-N+1 grep and its DataLoader seam don't match either;
  the defect is purely the **round-trip count**, invisible at any single line and
  visible only as a writes-per-request count or a throughput cliff under load.
  **Fix:** collapse the loop into **one** batched write — `insertMany` / a single
  multi-row `INSERT … VALUES (…),(…)` / `COPY` / the ORM's `createMany`/
  `bulkCreate` / a batched upsert — chunked to a *bounded* number of round-trips
  where the driver caps batch size (still O(chunks), not O(rows)), inside one
  transaction where atomicity matters. **`Promise.all(items.map(x =>
  db.insertOne(x)))` is not the fix** — it overlaps the latency but still issues N
  round-trips and can swamp the connection pool or serialize on write locks; the
  lever is *one* call for N rows, not N calls at once. Preserve the per-row error
  attribution the loop gave you — a bulk write that aborts the whole batch on one
  bad row loses per-item isolation, so map failures back to rows (ordered /
  continue-on-error + collect the rejects) when partial success matters. Distinct
  from **N+1** above (a *read* per row of a *prior query result*, fixed by a join /
  `IN` / eager-load — here it is a *write* per item of the handler's *own input*,
  fixed by a bulk-write API) and from the **Sequential `await`s** / twin-projection
  concurrency bullets below (a fixed handful of *distinct* calls parallelized with
  `Promise.all` — here it is N *identical* writes that must be *batched into one*,
  where `Promise.all` is the wrong tool).
- **Indexes**: the columns in `WHERE`/`JOIN`/`ORDER BY` on hot queries are
  indexed and the index is actually used — confirm with the query plan
  (`EXPLAIN`/`EXPLAIN ANALYZE`); a seq scan on a large table is the finding.
  Watch for indexes made unusable by a function/cast on the column, or by
  leading-wildcard `LIKE`.
- **Over-fetch**: no `SELECT *` when a few columns are needed; select only what is used.
  Result sets are bounded and paginated. Prefer **keyset/seek** pagination over a large
  `OFFSET` — which is not only a scan-cost problem but a **correctness** one: `LIMIT/OFFSET`
  is *positional*, so a row inserted before the window between two page fetches shifts
  everything down and **duplicates a row across pages** (a delete before it **skips** one);
  a `(sort_key, id)` cursor is stable under concurrent writes (the cursor key must be
  unique/tie-broken — see the non-unique-timestamp-cursor trap in
  `time-date-correctness.md`). (use-the-index-luke, *no-offset*.) This drift isn't only a
  concurrent-write hazard: `LIMIT`/`OFFSET` with no `ORDER BY` that constrains rows to a
  unique order is undefined even on a **static table with zero writes**, because the query
  planner may choose a different plan — and therefore a different row order — for different
  `LIMIT`/`OFFSET` values on identical data ("you are very likely to get different plans
  (yielding different row orders) depending on what you give for LIMIT and OFFSET,"
  PostgreSQL §7.6 *LIMIT and OFFSET*); no writes between page fetches does not make plain
  `OFFSET` pagination safe — only a total, unique `ORDER BY` does.
- **Whole-collection payload for a single-entity view**: a generic detail overlay/drawer (opened
  from many pages, for many entity kinds) whose data source returns the **entire** underlying
  collection on every open — not a projection sized to the one requested id — because a few renderers
  cross-reference sibling entities. The whole-collection shape is usually defended by a real,
  previously-litigated correctness comment, which stops review from asking the **orthogonal**
  question: given that shape, why is it *also* uncached? Marked `no-store` "because the data
  can change" (or simply carrying no `Cache-Control` or validators at all — for a dynamic,
  likely-credentialed JSON response, uncacheable in practice either way), it recomputes and
  retransmits a large **build-time/batch-static**
  majority (descriptions, formulas, prompts) in full on every open, while only a small slice (a live
  status, a pending-changes index) is genuinely request-volatile. Fix: branch on the requested
  id/kind for a right-sized projection where the cross-reference requirement allows; and split
  caching — cache the deterministic majority (keyed by the data's version/build id, or HTTP
  cache/ETag) and fetch only the volatile slice per request. Pin a **byte-size ceiling** regression
  test, since this surface is paid from every mount site (grep the fan-in) and grows silently with
  the collection. Distinct from column-level over-fetch above (that trims columns; this trims the
  row-set *shape* and fixes the caching axis) — and from the redundant-full-collection-scan bullet
  below: that removes a scan whose only purpose is dedupe/freshness (which must stay current, never
  cached), whereas here the whole-collection shape is legitimate and only the volatile slice needs
  current data, so the deterministic majority is safe to cache.
- **Push work to the DB**: filter/aggregate/join in SQL, not by pulling rows into
  app memory and looping. But don't hide an unbounded computation behind a view.
- **Connections & transactions**: a pooled connection (not one per call) — and
  likewise reuse one HTTP/SDK client per process, since constructing a fresh
  client per call throws away its connection pool; transactions scoped as tightly
  as correctness allows; no long transaction held across a network/LLM call (lock
  contention); no application logic inside a DB lock window. A borrowed/checked-out pool connection must be
  **released on every path including the error/throw path** (the general form is `security-appsec.md`
  A10) — a leaked checkout starves the pool under load; watch **pool exhaustion** (active connections
  trending toward max with checkouts never returned) as its own symptom, distinct from constructing a
  fresh client per call above.
- **Hot partition / partition-key design (NoSQL)**: a low-cardinality or skewed
  partition key (a status enum, a single active tenant, a monotonically increasing
  timestamp prefix) concentrates traffic on one physical partition regardless of the
  table's overall provisioned or on-demand capacity. DynamoDB caps throughput **per
  partition**, not just per table: "Every partition in a DynamoDB table is designed to
  deliver a maximum capacity of 3,000 read units per second and 1,000 write units per
  second" (AWS, DynamoDB partition-key best practices) — a hot key throttles long before the
  table-level limit is anywhere near reached, and raising table-level provisioned or
  on-demand capacity does not fix a single-partition hotspot. Fix: choose a
  high-cardinality key that spreads access evenly, or shard a naturally hot key with a
  random or calculated suffix (write sharding) and fan the read back in.

## Schema & data migrations (safety)

Migration safety is filed in domain E but is **reviewed here even when the PR
carries no query-performance change** — so domain E is not marked N/A once a diff
touches a migration, and domains F (`reliability-error-handling.md`) and K
(`release-engineering.md`) route to this section rather than restating it.

A migration is a deploy-time hazard, not just a query. Check:
- **Locking**: `ALTER TABLE` / `CREATE INDEX` on a large table without the
  non-blocking variant (`CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY` in Postgres — use the engine's
  online-DDL equivalent elsewhere, e.g. MySQL `ALGORITHM=INPLACE` or gh-ost; plus
  safe column-add order) locks writes and can take an outage.
- **A failed or transaction-wrapped `CONCURRENTLY` build is its own hazard.** On Postgres a
  failed concurrent index build "will fail but leave behind an 'invalid' index" — one "ignored
  for querying purposes" that "will still consume update overhead" (Postgres docs); recover by
  dropping and retrying, or `REINDEX INDEX CONCURRENTLY`, never by assuming the index is simply
  absent. And `CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY` **cannot run inside a transaction block** (a regular
  `CREATE INDEX` can), so a migration runner that wraps each migration in one transaction by
  default must use its escape hatch or the concurrent build fails outright.
- **Backward compatibility during rolling deploy**: old and new code run
  simultaneously mid-deploy — a migration must be compatible with both. Follow
  expand → migrate → contract: add the new column/table (nullable), backfill,
  switch reads/writes, then remove the old — across separate deploys, never in
  one destructive step.
- **`RENAME COLUMN` / `RENAME TABLE` is the canonical accidental in-place break.**
  A bare Postgres rename is metadata-only and fast, so it *looks* atomic and safe —
  but it is a **backward-incompatible interface change**: old pods still running
  mid-deploy select/write the old name, which no longer exists, and error until the
  rollout finishes. File it as a **compatibility** hazard, not a locking one (it
  takes no meaningful lock). The expand → migrate → contract path above *is* Martin
  Fowler's **parallel change** (also known as expand and contract) — "a pattern to
  implement backward-incompatible changes to an interface in a safe manner"
  (`ParallelChange`);
  a rename must run it (add the new name alongside the old via a column or view, cut
  readers then writers over, drop the old in a later deploy), never as one step.
- **`NOT NULL` without a default** on an existing table breaks inserts from old
  code and can rewrite the whole table; add nullable + default first, backfill,
  then enforce. This is conservative, though — it omits *what actually triggers the
  rewrite*. A **non-volatile (constant) default is metadata-only**: Postgres stores
  the value in the catalog, "making the `ALTER TABLE` very fast even on large tables
  … In neither case is a rewrite of the table required" (`sql-altertable.html`). A
  full **table-and-index rewrite** is forced only by a narrower set — flag these
  four by name: a **volatile default** (e.g. `clock_timestamp()`), a **stored
  generated column**, an **identity column**, or a **column whose domain type has
  constraints** — which "will cause the entire table and its indexes to be
  rewritten" (a *virtual* generated column never does). "We added a default, so it's
  safe" is the false friend. (This **rewrite** is a distinct mechanism from the
  constraint-family **validation-scan-under-lock** below: a rewrite rebuilds every
  row and index; a validation scan reads existing rows under lock without rebuilding
  them.)
- **Backfill** runs **outside** the DDL transaction, in bounded batches, so it
  doesn't hold a lock or blow up the transaction log.
- **Rollback path** exists and is tested; the migration is idempotent/resumable.
- **Take the rollback snapshot before the mutation, not after.**
- A migration that transforms data must not degrade it — cross-reference the
  monotonic-quality invariant in `data-quality.md`.
- **Lock *acquisition* is a hazard, not only lock *duration*.** Even an instant, metadata-only DDL
  must first **acquire** its lock; in PostgreSQL `ALTER TABLE` takes an `ACCESS EXCLUSIVE` lock that
  conflicts with every other mode. A single long-running transaction on the target makes the fast
  DDL wait — and because the lock manager grants a request only if it conflicts with no existing
  **or already-waiting** lock (`src/backend/storage/lmgr/README`), the pending `ACCESS EXCLUSIVE`
  then makes **every later request queue behind it** — a fast migration becomes a table-wide stall
  (the wait-queue / FIFO rule; the user-facing `explicit-locking` docs describe the wait but not
  this queue effect by name). Check: run DDL with a bounded `lock_timeout` + retry/backoff, and
  confirm no long transaction is open on the target.
- **Backfill throttles on an observed backpressure signal, not just batch size.** Bounded batches
  cap transaction-log growth, not replica lag or I/O saturation; the loop reads a live signal
  (replication lag, load, error rate) and pauses above a documented ceiling — a fixed inter-batch
  sleep with no signal is not a throttle (gh-ost's replica-lag throttling, already named above, is
  the reference shape).
- **The constraint-add hazard is a family, not just `NOT NULL`.** Adding `UNIQUE` / `FOREIGN KEY` /
  `CHECK`, or changing a column type, on a populated table triggers the same full-table
  validation-scan-under-lock already flagged for `NOT NULL` — a reviewer matching the literal
  `NOT NULL` misses the siblings. Use the two-phase form: `ADD CONSTRAINT … NOT VALID` (commits
  immediately, no scan) then a separate `VALIDATE CONSTRAINT` (weaker `SHARE UPDATE EXCLUSIVE` lock,
  existing rows only); for uniqueness, `CREATE UNIQUE INDEX CONCURRENTLY` then `ADD CONSTRAINT …
  USING INDEX`; treat a type change as a rewrite hazard on the same expand-contract path. (Distinct
  from the soft-delete `UNIQUE` partial-index rule in `data-quality.md`, a NULL-semantics bug, not a
  lock/scan-cost one.)
- **`migrate` is dual-write plus a completion proof, not one step.** While the backfill runs, every
  write path writes **both** the old and new location so no row lands only in the old shape; before
  cutting reads over, the two are verified to **agree** with an explicit zero-remaining-gap check —
  not "the backfill job exited 0" — gating the enforce/contract step. Distinct from the cross-system
  dual-write in `reliability-error-handling.md` (DB + bus atomicity); this is the same-table case.

## External / API / LLM calls — the cost-and-value lens

The org-level frame is **FinOps** — cost as a continuous practice, not a one-time audit:
**inform** (tag/allocate spend to a team, feature, or environment so it is *visible* and
attributable), **optimize** (rightsize, commit/reserve steady load, kill idle or orphaned
resources), **operate** (a budget with an **anomaly alert** and a named **owner**). A cloud bill
with no allocation/tagging, no owner, or no anomaly alert is a finding independent of any one
call's cost — and, per `release-engineering.md`, buying a cost tool before the spend is allocated just
visualizes an unattributed bill.

Every billable or slow call must map to value delivered.
- **Necessity**: is the call needed *now*, or is it "call it every run/every
  request" out of habit? Unchanged inputs should not be re-fetched, re-embedded,
  or re-scraped. Cache by a correct key with correct invalidation. The sharpest
  version is an external call in the render body of a dynamic / `no-store` page
  (or a hot handler): it fires on *every* view, bounded only by how often humans
  or bots hit it — invisible until the bill or a rate-limit lands. Data identical
  for all viewers is cached globally, not per user.
- **Near-static config**: schema, field definitions, enum/dropdown options,
  feature flags, and other slowly-changing config fetched at request rate are
  effectively constants pulled over the wire on every call. Cache with a long TTL,
  or promote genuinely fixed values to committed configuration with a startup
  check that they still match the source — so drift fails loudly at boot instead
  of silently.
- **Redundant full-collection scans**: "fetch the whole list/table to find or
  dedupe one item" is O(collection) calls (pagination) for an O(1) need; doing the
  *same* scan twice in one logical operation (a handler scans, then a helper it
  calls scans it again) doubles it. Fetch once and pass the result down, or use a
  targeted lookup. Do **not** cache a scan whose purpose is dedupe or a freshness
  check — correctness needs current data there; remove the redundancy, don't stale
  it.
- **Batch** where the API allows (one request for N items beats N requests);
  **de-dupe** identical concurrent calls (single-flight).
- **Events over polling**: replace tight polling with webhooks/streaming where
  available; if polling, back off and use conditional requests
  (ETag/If-None-Match/If-Modified-Since).
- **Spend governance**: enforce caps in code **before** the call — per-call,
  per-session/request, **and** a global/daily/monthly cap for scheduled or
  unattended jobs (a per-run cap alone won't stop a runaway schedule). Circuit
  breakers on 402/429; bounded retries with exponential backoff + jitter that
  honor `Retry-After`, kept to **one** layer — a custom retry loop wrapping an SDK
  that already retries multiplies requests (N × M) on every transient error.
- **The spend-safety holes** (verify each — two unrelated engagements independently
  hit them):
  - **A cap that defaults to off is not a cap.** Check the *default value* of
    every spend/row/rate cap; a per-run cap whose env var defaults to
    `0`/unlimited leaves a bare, freshly-configured run bounded only by the global
    aggregate. A paid pass with **no dry-run/apply switch at all** is the same
    gap.
  - **A ledger loader that fails open.** `try { readWholeFile } catch {
    events = [] }` on a spend/rate accumulator zeroes month-to-date on *any* read
    fault (permissions, IO, truncation) and disables the ceiling. Branch
    **ENOENT** (absent → empty is correct) vs a fault on a **present** file (fail
    closed). **Test the present-fault branch:** unreadable path (`EACCES`), path
    is a directory (`EISDIR`), truncated/invalid body — `guard` must refuse the
    paid call, not proceed as if spend were zero.
  - **`SELECT sum()` then check-then-act is not atomic.** Concurrent callers each
    read the pre-spend total and both spend. Use an atomic reservation
    (insert-the-charge-first, or a transactional decrement/lock) — and a
    reservation a crashed worker never settles must **fail closed** (keep counting
    it against the budget) until a TTL or reconciliation reclaims it, or the
    ceiling leaks upward one dead worker at a time.
  - **Inaccurate cost math silently mis-drives the gate.** If the number feeding a
    spend cap charges cache-read / cache-write tokens at the full input rate (or
    ignores each token class's real price), it overstates spend and throttles or
    degrades work early — sometimes burning budget on a fallback that then blocks
    the real result; an *understated* number lets spend run past the cap. Bill
    each token class at its documented rate.
  - **An in-process singleton guard does not hold across processes.** A
    `globalThis` "is a job running?" flag or single-flight promise is per-process;
    if a second process (scheduler, worker, replica) shares the datastore, the
    guard is an illusion — verify it against the real process model (e.g. an
    entrypoint that runs `worker &` alongside the server).
- **Calibrate before a big paid run**: dry-run a small **zero-write** sample,
  measure real cost-per-call and failure rate, then extrapolate and get sign-off
  before the full apply. Don't discover the bill after the batch.
- **LLM specifics**: `max_tokens` and `timeout` set; prompt/response sizes
  bounded — but a *size* bound is not a drop-priority: what silently gets shed when the
  assembled input overflows (often the system instructions) is governed by a correctness
  check at the context-assembly seam (`testing-and-evals.md`), not by this cost bound; a deterministic
  fallback path for when generation fails, with a
  counter reporting how often the fallback fired; don't ask the model to do work
  a function can do (see `security-ai-agents.md`). On cost:
  - **Prompt-cache breakpoint**: put the cacheable marker on the longest *stable*
    prefix (system prompt, instructions, schema, few-shot) and keep per-call
    content after it; a marker on content that varies per call caches nothing, and
    a prefix below the provider's minimum cacheable token count is a silent no-op
    — verify the threshold against the provider's current docs.
  - **Cache TTL vs inter-call latency**: a short cache TTL can expire *between*
    reuses when slow work (another call, a tool loop, research) runs in the gap,
    wasting the cache. Match the TTL to the real gap, or reorder work so cached
    calls sit close together.
  - **Token-count round-trips**: a separate `countTokens`-style call before each
    generation adds a round-trip and another rate-limited request (usually free of
    token charges, but latency and a failure point) — justify it or drop it.

## Caching & memoization

- Correct key (includes every input that changes the result; per-user/tenant
  where results differ) and correct **invalidation** (a stale-cache bug is worse
  than no cache). No caching of sensitive/per-user data in a shared cache.
- **Invalidate every *derived* entry, not just the entity's own key.** The correct-key rule
  above covers one entry; a write must also invalidate every composite / aggregate / list /
  rendered-fragment entry that *embeds* the mutated entity (a user's name cached inside a
  rendered comment, a row inside a cached list or count). HTTP caches make the split explicit:
  a cache "MUST invalidate the target URI" on an unsafe method but treats related URIs only as
  *candidates* for invalidation (RFC 9111 §4.4) — derived-key fan-out is the application's job,
  not the protocol's. Tag each entry with a surrogate key per entity it depends on and purge by
  tag, or keep an explicit dependency index; a write that clears only `entity:{id}` and leaves
  the entries embedding it is a stale-read bug no single-key test catches.
- Bounded size / TTL / eviction; a cache that only grows is a leak.
- **Bound key *cardinality*, not just total size.** A key built from an unbounded or
  high-cardinality input — raw free text, a full query string with volatile params, a
  per-request timestamp — makes almost every lookup miss while filling the cache with
  single-use entries, so it adds latency and memory pressure for no hit-rate benefit.
  Normalize and allow-list the key inputs to the dimensions that actually recur. Distinct from
  a *wrong* key (correctness, above) and from unbounded *total size* (the eviction bullet) —
  here the key *space* is too large to ever reuse.
- **Stampede / thundering herd on expiry.** A hot key expiring lets N concurrent
  misses all hit the origin at once — an outage amplifier on an expensive origin.
  Require **single-flight** (coalesce concurrent recomputes behind one lock/lease)
  or a **soft-TTL / early-recompute** with jitter; the de-dupe under *External
  calls* above is the same mechanism applied at cache-expiry.
- **An unconditional refresh-on-every-read cache is not a stampede risk (no expiry to race), but
  paired with a query whose sort the primary key can't serve, the two compound into a full-table
  sort on every single request — check both halves, not one.** A synchronous cache getter that
  fires a background reload on **every** call — single-flighted so concurrent calls collapse to one
  in-flight reload, but with **no TTL or staleness gate** at all — looks like a reasonable "never
  more than a request or two stale, never blocks" design in isolation, and often is: the
  single-flight guard means it isn't the stampede-on-expiry case above (there is no expiry here to
  race — the reload is retriggered by call volume, not by a timer). The compounding risk sits on the
  query side: a composite primary key covering the natural identity columns (`(tenant, as_of,
  recorded_at)`) reads as "the table is indexed" at a glance, but a hot read ordering by a
  **different** leading column (`ORDER BY as_of DESC, recorded_at DESC` — newest-first by date
  rather than by the PK's leading id) can't be served by that PK — with no matching index, the
  engine scans and sorts the **whole table** on every execution (*Indexes*, above, for the
  EXPLAIN-driven detection). Reviewed separately, each half is defensible (a documented, deliberate
  cache policy; a table that visibly has a primary key); reviewed together, an unpruned append-only
  source table growing in one dimension and read frequency growing in another multiply into a
  per-request full-table sort that is invisible while the table is small. **Fix:** add an index
  matching the actual `ORDER BY` shape and, independently, consider gating the reload behind a short
  TTL so read volume stops multiplying query volume 1:1.
- **Cache-aside write race.** Read-miss → load → set can interleave with a
  concurrent write so the cache ends up holding a value already superseded. Order
  it **write-store-then-invalidate** (not set-after-write), use versioned keys, or
  a delayed double-delete — a naive read-through caches a stale value with no
  conflict to warn.
- **Negative caching.** Caching a not-found / error masks a later create or a
  transient failure (stale 404s, cached errors); give negatives a **short,
  re-checkable TTL**, never the positive TTL.
- **Authoritative vs advisory — state which.** A cache treated as **source of
  truth** (write-only-to-cache, no durable store behind it) turns an eviction into
  **data loss**. (Identity-keyed caching as an authorization surface —
  `private`/`no-store`, per-principal keys — is `security-appsec.md` A01.)
- **A shared cache must key on whatever varies the representation.** When a response differs by
  request header — `Accept-Language`, `Accept-Encoding`, a currency/tenant negotiated from a
  header — a shared or CDN cache that ignores it serves one visitor's variant to another
  (English to a German reader, gzip to a client that can't decode it). HTTP formalizes the key
  rule: a cache "MUST NOT use that stored response without revalidation unless all the presented
  request header fields nominated by that Vary field value match" (RFC 9111 §4.1), and `Vary: *`
  never matches. Include every representation-varying dimension in the cache key (a correct
  `Vary`, or explicit key dimensions). Distinct from the identity/authz `Vary` rule in
  `security-appsec.md` (threat: a cross-user *auth* leak) — this is content-negotiation
  correctness.

## Concurrency, memory & payloads

- I/O-bound work is async/parallel where safe; CPU-bound work isn't blocking the
  event loop / request thread. Backpressure and timeouts on every external call.
- **Sequential `await`s with no data dependency are an accidental serialization, not
  a design choice.** A request handler / page data loader / GraphQL resolver that
  assembles one response from a few independent backend calls (a main entity fetch
  plus an unrelated sidebar, count, or config read) is often written in natural
  top-to-bottom order, `await`-ing each call before the next line runs. A call that
  reads nothing produced by an earlier call has no data reason to wait for it, yet
  still runs last — the handler pays the *sum* of every call's latency instead of
  the *max*, adding a full extra round-trip to time-to-first-byte on every request.
  The code stays correct (right data, right shape), so nothing fails; it surfaces
  only as a slow-page field report or a TTFB regression, not a test. Detect by
  listing, for each `await` in the function, whether its arguments (or a variable it
  closes over) trace back to a *preceding* `await`'s result in that same function —
  any call whose inputs don't is a parallelization candidate regardless of what it
  does. Fix by starting every mutually-independent call together
  (`Promise.all`/`Promise.allSettled`, `asyncio.gather`, an errgroup) and keeping
  sequential only the calls that truly consume a prior call's output — a call that
  reads `main.ids` after fetching `main` is a genuine dependency and correctly stays
  sequential; that shape is not the anti-pattern. Distinct from **N+1** above (a
  query *per row* of an existing result — this is a handful of independent
  *top-level* calls, present even for a single row/request) and from the
  client-side critical-request-chain waterfall in `frontend-a11y.md`'s Core Web
  Vitals section (the browser's dependent-fetch chain hurting LCP/TTI, versus the
  server handler's own `await` ordering hurting TTFB here). And distinct from the
  terse `async/parallel where safe` line above, which states the principle: this
  names the concrete failure shape (sum-vs-max latency), the detection trace (each
  `await`'s arguments back to a prior `await`'s result), and the genuine-dependency
  carve-out that one-liner leaves implicit. **A *correct* concurrent group already
  in the function is not proof the whole function is parallel — run that same trace
  on every `await`, including the ones *after* a group.** The recurring shape is a
  loader that already starts its first reads together (a `Promise.all`, a
  hoisted-promise pair, an `asyncio.gather`) and then, in a later change, tacks a
  new independent read on *after* the group as a lone `await`: its author added read
  k+1 at its natural point-of-use without reopening the top-of-function group, and
  its inputs never trace back to anything the group returns, so it has no data
  reason to run last yet still adds its full round-trip to the sum. The group's
  presence is the camouflage — a reviewer reads it as "concurrency already handled"
  and the change added only one line, with the group it should have joined sitting
  unchanged (often outside the diff hunk), so a diff-only pass waves it through.
  Tell it apart from a never-parallelized loader by *provenance*: the group and the
  trailing read land in different commits (blame / `git log -L` on the function).
  Fix by starting the new read *with* the group, not beside it — but preserve its
  error handling in the move: a fail-all group (`Promise.all`/`gather`) rejects as a
  whole on any member's failure and discards the siblings' results, so a read that
  carried its own `.catch`/fallback loses that isolation if it is blindly folded in.
  Hoist it to its own promise, keep the `.catch` on it (or use `Promise.allSettled`),
  and `await` it at its point of use — keeping the latency win without coupling a
  non-critical read's failure to the critical ones.
- **Two projections of one dataset that each re-load the raw source, awaited one after the
  other, pay double I/O *and* double latency — the compute-once-derive-many miss inside a
  single handler.** A request handler / SSR loader that needs two differently-shaped views
  of the *same* data (a summary card and a detail table; a totals rollup and a line-item
  list; a chart series and its CSV export) often calls two exported helpers —
  `getSummary()` and `getDetails()` — that each *internally* re-run the shared loader
  (`loadRawEvents()` then reduce it one way; `loadRawEvents()` again then reduce it the
  other) and `await`s them in top-to-bottom order. The shared read runs **twice** (2× DB
  query / file read / API call) and the two reads **serialize** though neither consumes the
  other's output — 2× the I/O *and* 2× the latency on a critical path (TTFB / SSR). Each
  helper is clean in isolation (right data, right shape), so a per-file review approves
  both; the waste lives only in the *pair* and shows only as the network tab's two
  identical source reads and a load time that is their sum. Rank the fix: **read the source
  once and pass the records into both projections** (best — it deletes the second read, and
  with one read there is nothing left to parallelize); **`Promise.all` on the two helpers
  is only the fallback for when they must stay independent — it overlaps the latency but
  still reads the source twice**, a partial fix, not the fix. Detect by listing every
  `await` a handler makes into the same data module before it branches, then confirming the
  shared loader runs ≤1× per request and any reads left separate run concurrently;
  acceptance = one source read per request, both projections' outputs unchanged. Distinct
  from **Redundant full-collection scans** (External / API / LLM calls), whose subject is a
  collection pulled for an O(1) find/dedupe it never needed — here the full dataset is *legitimately*
  required, only read once too often and shaped twice. Distinct from the **Sequential
  `await`s** bullet above, whose independent calls read *different* sources so `Promise.all`
  is the whole fix — here they read the *same* source, so `Promise.all` leaves the duplicate
  read standing. Distinct from the client-side **identity fan-out** hook in
  `frontend-a11y.md` (N mounted consumers each re-fetching one shared singleton, coalesced
  behind a Provider/cache): this is two sibling projections inside *one* handler, coalesced
  by hoisting the single read and deriving both locally.
- **An expensive `await` placed *above* an early return is paid on every request that takes
  the early branch — even when that branch never reads its result.** A handler / loader /
  resolver fetches something costly at the top (a DB query, an API/LLM call, a full-collection
  read) and only *then* hits a guard that returns early on the common path — a cache hit, a
  `304`, an empty/redirect/short-circuit response, a permission or feature-flag bail — where
  the returning branch does not consume the fetched value; only the *rarely-taken* rest of the
  function does. Because the fetch runs before the guard, **every** request pays for it and the
  hot branch discards the result, so the app issues and throws away that query on its most
  frequent path. It reads clean line-by-line — the fetch genuinely is needed *somewhere* in the
  function — and the waste is purely the **ordering**: the call sits before the branch that
  decides it isn't needed. Common shapes: a page loader that reads the full record/list at the
  top for an edge-case render but returns a cached or empty response on the common branch
  without touching it; a resolver that `await`s an enrichment call before an authorization or
  feature-gate early-return. **Fix — relocate the call, don't cache it:** move the `await`
  *below* the early return so only the branch that consumes it issues it, or make it lazy (a
  thunk / deferred promise the consuming branch awaits) so the hot path never triggers it.
  Caching (the *Necessity* bullet's cure above) does **not** fix this — a cached read is still a
  needless lookup on a branch that discards its result; the lever is *where the call sits*, not
  *how often it recomputes*. Detect: for each `await` in the function, confirm its result is
  read on **every** branch that can `return` after it — an `await` whose value is consumed only
  *past* an earlier `return` is the finding; acceptance = count the call's invocations on the
  early-return path (zero after the fix, one per request before). Distinct from **Sequential
  `await`s** and the **twin-projection** bullet above, whose reads are all genuinely *used* (fix
  = parallelize, or read once) — here the read is *unused on the branch that always runs*, so
  only relocating the call helps; from **over-fetch / whole-collection** above, which trim what a
  *used* result contains (here nothing on the hot path uses it); and from dead code in
  `domain-checklists.md` §H (an unreferenced function nobody calls) — here the call **runs** on
  every request and only its *result* is dead on the hot branch.
- No unbounded growth: ever-growing lists/maps/caches, accumulating `defer`s,
  unclosed resources. Stream large data instead of buffering it all in memory.
- **Every append-only store on disk names a reaper — unbounded growth fills the disk, a
  total outage.** Distinct from the in-memory growth above: logs, temp/scratch files, an
  audit/event table, a dead-letter queue, a metrics/trace store, or an uploads / on-disk
  artifact directory — a filesystem path with no eviction primitive, distinct from the
  in-memory/Redis cache under *Caching & memoization* above — that only ever grows will
  eventually **fill the disk and take the whole host down** (a slow-motion, time-triggered
  outage no single request reveals; a full disk can also halt the database). For each, confirm a **retention/rotation policy with an actual
  reaper** (log rotation with a size+age cap; a TTL / partition-drop on the audit/event
  table; DLQ trimming with depth alerting; temp-file cleanup that also runs on the **crash
  path**, since a crashed process skips its own `finally`) and a **disk-headroom
  monitor/alert ahead of full** (a free-space threshold, not the outage). A store that grows
  with traffic with no bounding mechanism is the finding. (Outage consequence →
  `reliability-error-handling.md`; alert wiring → `observability.md`.)
- Payloads are reasonable; no shipping a megabyte to render a number.

handler/loader with independent `await`s run in top-to-bottom order where none
reads an earlier call's result (accidental serialization, not a genuine
dependency); a `Promise.all`/`gather` immediately followed by a standalone `await`
whose arguments don't reference the group's results (an independent read appended
past an existing concurrent group instead of folded into it); a handler `await`ing
two helpers that each re-read the *same* source to build different projections
(fetch-per-projection instead of read-once-derive-both); an expensive `await`
(DB/API/LLM/full-collection read) placed above an early return whose returning (hot) branch
never reads its result (paid and discarded every request — move the call below the return or
make it lazy); an `await`ed single-row write (`insertOne`/`save`/`create`/multi-row
`INSERT`) inside a `for`/`map` over an *input* collection (serialized round-trips,
correctly awaited so a missing-`await` scan passes — collapse to one bulk write, not N
parallel writes).
