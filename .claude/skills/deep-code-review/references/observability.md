# Observability, audit trails & recoverability

Read this when reviewing logging, metrics, traces, dashboards, alerting, audit
trails, or "could we tell this broke, reconstruct who did it, and restore what
was lost." Expands section M of `SKILL.md`; the security-event slice is A09 in
`security-appsec.md` (log the right events, tamper-resistant, alerted), and the
failure paths that *produce* these signals are section F /
`reliability-error-handling.md`.

---

## Detection procedure

1. **Pick the two or three flows that matter** (the paid pipeline, the login
   path, the checkout/write path). For each: if it broke silently at 3am, what
   fires? Trace the answer to a real alert rule, not a dashboard nobody opens.
2. **Read the log lines on the failure path**, not the happy path — that's where
   raw request/response objects get dumped.
3. **Enumerate metric emitters**; read label/tag arguments for unbounded values.
4. **Find the audit trail** for destructive and privilege-changing operations,
   and check who can edit or delete it.
5. **Find the backup config, then the restore evidence** — a backup with no
   documented, dated restore drill is untested.

## Golden signals & alerting

- Cover **latency, traffic, errors, saturation** per critical service or job —
  plus, for batch/pipeline work, *freshness* (time since last successful run) and
  *volume* (records processed vs. expected). Average latency hides the outage;
  use percentiles (p50/p95/p99).
- **Saturation's alert line is a utilization *target below 100%*, not full.** Many systems
  degrade in latency/throughput well before a resource reaches 100% utilization, so the useful
  threshold is a target (often ~70-80%, workload-dependent), not saturation itself — track
  utilization / saturation / errors for each constrained resource. Alerting only at 100% (or on
  `load average` alone) misses the whole degradation window. (The target is itself a *cause*
  alert — pair it with a user-facing *symptom* alert per the bullet below, don't ship it alone.)
- **Alert on the symptom, not only the cause.** "CPU > 80%" without "checkout
  error rate > 1%" or "no successful run in 2× the schedule interval" means a
  frozen job or dependency outage pages nobody. Cause alerts are for diagnosis;
  symptom alerts are the contract with the user. Each alert names an owner and a
  next action — constantly-firing alerts train the team to ignore the page.
- **Distinguish transport/quota failure from a substantive negative result.** A
  429/402/timeout recorded as "no match" or "score 0" silently corrupts metrics
  and downstream data (`data-quality.md`). Health/readiness endpoints must check
  real dependencies, not `return 200`.
- **Instrument LLM / agent calls as first-class telemetry, not just the host service.** An LLM or
  agent feature shipped with only service-level latency/error signals is under-instrumented:
  capture per-call **token usage** (prompt/completion), **latency** and **cost**, the **model +
  version** (and, for LLM calls, a **prompt version tag or template hash** — so a quality regression
  is attributable to the *prompt* revision, not just a model bump; `testing-ai-evals.md`), the
  **outcome** (success / error / refusal / empty / tool-call), and a **trace**
  spanning the agent's tool calls, so a failing or token-burning agent is visible — but emit
  **structured telemetry: counts and metadata, never the raw prompt/response payload** (redact per
  *Logs & traces* below; token *counts* need no prompt text). The **OpenTelemetry GenAI semantic
  conventions** (`gen_ai.*`) name these signals — adopt the convention **names** for portability,
  but that spec was **moved to a separate GenAI semantic-conventions repository** (the
  `gen_ai.*` entries in the main registry are now marked *Deprecated*), so **pin no version and
  re-fetch the current source before citing**. A
  silent, un-traced agent that errors or burns tokens with no signal is the finding (cross-ref the
  cost-and-value lens in `performance-db-cost.md`).

---

## Logs & traces: secrets, PII, injection

- **Redact by default**: an allow-list of loggable fields beats a deny-list of
  forbidden ones — over-logging is itself a vulnerability (A09). Left-behind
  `print` debugging is its own finding.
- Common leaks: whole request/response objects, `Authorization`/`Cookie` headers,
  bodies on 4xx/5xx, DSN-style connection strings in errors, LLM prompts with
  user data, stack traces with locals, query params carrying tokens or emails,
  error-tracker breadcrumbs.
- **Spans carry the same risk**: span attributes, DB statements with inlined
  literals, HTTP instrumentation recording full URLs and headers. Sampling does
  not make a leak safe — a 1%-sampled secret is still leaked, into a third-party
  store. Log/trace retention counts as personal-data retention
  (`privacy-compliance.md`).
- **Head-based trace sampling limits what you can conclude — mind coverage, variance, and
  tail percentiles.** A fixed-rate, *pre-outcome* (**head**) sampler decides keep/drop
  before it knows the trace errored or ran slow. For a *uniform* sampler the sampled error
  *proportion* is still an unbiased estimate of the true rate — the real problems are
  elsewhere: **(a) coverage** — you cannot guarantee a *specific* error trace was kept ("you
  cannot ensure that all traces with an error within them are sampled with head sampling
  alone", OpenTelemetry), so tracing is unreliable for "pull up *this* incident's traces";
  **(b) variance** — at a low sample rate the error/slow counts in a short burn-rate window
  are tiny and noisy, under-reading an incident more often than not; **(c) tail estimation**
  — a thinned tail makes p99/p999 unstable and biased. An *adaptive / load-shedding* head
  sampler that drops more under load is worse: it correlates keep/drop with system state,
  biasing the rate exactly when it matters. Fix: use **tail sampling** (decide "considering
  all or most of the spans within the trace", OpenTelemetry) with a policy that always keeps
  error / high-latency traces, and compute rate & latency SLIs from **unsampled** counters /
  histograms (the SLO/burn-rate lens in `role-coverage.md`), not the sampled trace set.
  (Distinct from the privacy point above — a sampled leak is still a leak — and from
  analytics event-stream reweighting in `data-metrics.md`.)
- **Log injection**: user-controlled strings must be emitted as structured
  fields, never concatenated into a line — embedded `\n`/`\r` lets an attacker
  forge entries and break the parser (CRLF/log-forging, CWE-117 — name only,
  verify before citing). Key-value logging avoids this by construction.
- Correlation/request id propagated across services and present on every line so
  an incident can be reassembled; log levels used meaningfully. A shared **log**
  correlation id is **not** the same guarantee as an unbroken **distributed trace** —
  every service can stamp the same id on its logs while each still starts a fresh root
  span, so logs reassemble by grep but the trace backend shows N disconnected
  fragments and you can't see where latency went. Verify separately: follow one
  request's trace id through every hop **in the tracing backend**, and confirm **one**
  trace, not N. The break is almost always at a hop without auto-instrumentation — a
  **queue publish, a cron / background job, an async or thread handoff** — where trace
  context must be injected into the envelope by hand (W3C `traceparent`) instead of
  riding an instrumented HTTP client; such a boundary that starts a fresh root span
  silently blinds the trace, and nothing fails until an incident needs it.
- **Telemetry carries a stable resource identity, or per-cohort analysis silently
  merges.** Every emitted signal (log, metric, span) should stamp *which service,
  version, and instance* produced it and *which environment/tier* it belongs to — the
  OpenTelemetry resource attributes `service.name` / `service.version` /
  `service.instance.id` / `service.namespace` and `deployment.environment.name` (all
  **Stable**), or an equivalent version+environment dimension. Distinct from the
  request-identity family above (that is *which request*; this is *which emitter*), and
  without it two things this skill demands elsewhere quietly break. A **canary's named
  halt metric** (`release-engineering.md`) is uncomputable as canary-vs-baseline unless
  the telemetry is partitioned by `service.version` (or a cohort tag) — you cannot
  regress-check a signal you cannot split from the baseline's. And **multi-window
  burn-rate SLO math** (`role-coverage.md`, SRE lens) corrupts when environments
  collide in one backend — which is the **default**, not an edge case: the OTel spec
  states `deployment.environment.name` "does not affect the uniqueness constraints
  defined through the `service.namespace`, `service.name` and `service.instance.id`
  resource attributes," so `service.name=frontend` in production and in staging
  "MUST be considered to be identifying the same service," and staging errors land in
  the production SLO unless an environment/namespace dimension separates them. **Verify:**
  the pipeline sets a stable service+version+instance identity and an environment tag; a
  canary or per-environment dashboard reading an unpartitioned metric is measuring a blend.
- **Audit the logs a platform injects, not only your app's log statements.** A
  managed platform often runs an nginx / auth-proxy **sidecar** in front of each
  app that logs, on **every authenticated request**, per-request user PII and the full
  permission-scope list — an authz dump the app itself never writes — to the
  platform's **shared** log store, while the application container logs none of it,
  so a review scoped to the app's own code misses it entirely. Read the **runtime**
  logs as actually emitted (app **and** the injected proxy), flag per-request PII /
  token material / authz-scope dumps to the platform owner as a log-hygiene issue
  (drop or redact), and treat a shared platform log store as a data-egress surface
  for user PII.

**Grep leads (tune to language):** `log`/`logger`/`console.log`/`print` followed
by `req`, `request`, `body`, `headers`, `user`, `token`, `password`, `secret`,
`apiKey`, `authorization`; `JSON.stringify(` inside a log call; `%+v`/`repr()`
of a request or config struct; `setTag`/`setAttribute` with a raw payload.

---

## Metric cardinality bombs

- Never use unbounded values as label/tag values: user id, email, request id,
  UUID, full URL path with ids, raw error message, SQL text. Each combination is
  a new time series — this is how a metrics bill or the backend falls over.
- Bound the label space: templated route (`/users/:id`), error *class* not error
  text, tenant tier not tenant id. Per-entity detail belongs in a log or trace.

**Grep leads:** metric/counter calls whose tag map includes `id`, `uuid`, `path`,
`url`, `email`, `err.message`, or a string-interpolated name
(`counter("job." + name)`).

---

## Metric type & shape correctness

- **A histogram/percentile can look measured and still lie, two ways.** A
  **classic (fixed-bucket) histogram** needs a bucket boundary exactly *at*
  the SLO threshold for a fraction-under-threshold query
  (`rate(..._bucket{le="0.3"}[5m])`) to resolve — Prometheus: no matching
  bucket means "no result is returned at all"; if only some of the
  aggregated histograms (e.g. some replicas) have one, "an incomplete result
  is returned, but without any warning…" Native/exponential-bucket
  histograms interpolate around this and largely avoid this silent dropout
  (the interpolated estimate stays approximately accurate, not exact). Separately,
  `avg()`/`mean()` over a `quantile="0.95"`-labeled (Summary) or
  `_p9[0-9]`-suffixed series — pooling replicas or windows — is invalid:
  Prometheus, on the replica case, "averaging the quantiles yields
  statistically nonsensical values." The reason generalizes: a quantile
  isn't linear in the distribution, so pooling means summing the raw
  buckets and recomputing the quantile once, never averaging ones already
  computed. Distinct from the head-sampling bullet above — that one is
  about the trace *source*'s representativeness; this one assumes an
  already-unsampled histogram (that bullet's own fix) and shows the
  bucket/aggregation math can still lie.
- **Instrument-type mismatch reads clean and lies.** Prometheus: "if the
  value can go down, it is a gauge," and "you should never take a rate() of
  a gauge" — `rate()`/`increase()` automatically adjust for *any* counter
  reset (Prometheus: "Breaks in monotonicity … are automatically adjusted
  for"), on the built-in assumption a reset means a process restart; a
  "counter" zeroed by anything else — a manual or scheduled reset, a
  business-logic zero — still triggers that same adjustment, but the
  assumption no longer holds, so the reading right at each reset silently
  saws or mis-counts, no error thrown. (OpenTelemetry, **Development**-status) An
  `UpDownCounter` incremented and decremented under different attribute sets
  forks into two never-reconciled series — "those increments and decrements
  will end up as different timeseries," e.g. `active_requests` incremented
  at request-start, decremented at request-end with one extra attribute
  (`status_code`, known only at the end) added on the decrement.
- **A metric absent until first occurrence is a blind spot, not a zero.**
  Prometheus: such series are "difficult to deal with... export a default
  value such as 0 for any time series you know may exist in advance." Until
  then, a ratio built on it (`errors_total{type="x"} / requests_total`)
  returns no data, not 0 — easy to misdiagnose as "monitoring is broken" —
  and a deadman/absence health check can't tell "healthy and quiet" from
  "crashed and emitting nothing," both reading as no series. Distinct from
  the golden-signals bullet on a quota/transport failure miscategorized as a
  result — that's a wrong *value*; this is no series at all.
- **One unit per metric identity, never mixed.** Mixing seconds and
  milliseconds under one metric name corrupts `sum()`/`avg()` and can
  silently miscalibrate an alert threshold 1000x when the unit changes.
  Prometheus suffixes the unit into the name; OpenTelemetry keeps it out of
  the name (instrument metadata) — only "one unit, never mixed" is
  stack-agnostic; don't prescribe either naming convention as universal.

**Grep leads:** `rate(`/`increase(` applied to something not named
`*_total`/`*_count`; `avg(`/`mean(` wrapping a `quantile=`-labeled or
`_p9[0-9]`-suffixed series; a `Histogram`/`Summary` constructor with no
`buckets=`/`objectives` backing a stated SLO; a `Gauge`/`.set(`/`.dec(` call
on something named like a counter; an `UpDownCounter` `.add()` whose
attribute set differs between its increment and decrement call sites; an
error/outcome counter incremented only inside a conditional branch with no
unconditional zero-init at startup.

## Audit trail & repudiation

- Destructive, financial, permission, and configuration changes need an audit
  record answering **who, what, when, from where, old value → new value** — an
  UPDATE overwriting a row with no history can't answer "who changed this."
- **Append-only**: no UPDATE/DELETE grants for the application role on the audit
  table, or ship to a write-once/external sink. A trail the acting user (or the
  app's own service account) can rewrite gives no non-repudiation.
- Record the **acting principal, not just the affected subject**; capture
  impersonation/admin-on-behalf-of explicitly. A failed audit write must fail the
  operation or raise loudly, never a silent `catch` (cross-ref
  `reliability-error-handling.md`).
- **Non-repudiation cuts both ways.** The append-only trail above is a *security*
  goal — the system can prove who did what, protecting the operator. From the **data
  subject's** side it is LINDDUN's *Non-repudiation* privacy *threat*: an immutable,
  over-broad log can strip a whistleblower's or abuse-victim's ability to plausibly
  deny a presence or action. Scope what the trail captures **about subjects** (as
  opposed to operators) to what a genuine dispute needs — the minimization bar in
  `privacy-compliance.md`, not "log everything about everyone forever."

---

## Backup & restore

- A backup that has never been restored is a hypothesis. Look for what is backed
  up (DB, object storage, secrets/config, IaC state), schedule, encryption,
  **off-instance/off-account copy**, retention, and a **dated restore drill**
  with a measured restore time.
- Stated RPO/RTO must reconcile with the backup interval and the drill's measured
  time; a mismatch is a finding. Restore is tested into a scratch environment,
  with a runbook followable by someone who didn't write it (`docs-and-dx.md`).
- Restoring an old snapshot can resurrect erased personal data — the erasure path
  must be re-applicable after a restore (cross-ref `privacy-compliance.md`).

---

**🚩 red flags**: no alert on the critical path; alerts only on causes; averages
only; health check that always returns 200; quota/transport failure counted as a
result; raw request/response/headers logged; secrets or PII in spans; user input
concatenated into log lines; unbounded metric labels; a latency SLO with no
histogram bucket at the objective threshold; a dashboard/alert averaging
pre-computed percentiles across instances; an alert or ratio denominator built
on a metric that only exists after first occurrence; destructive action with no
audit record; audit table the app can UPDATE/DELETE; stateful store with no
backup, no off-site copy, or no dated restore drill; a correlation/trace id
assumed to prove an unbroken trace with no verified context propagation across
service hops.
