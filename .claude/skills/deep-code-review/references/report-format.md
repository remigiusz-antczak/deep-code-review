# Findings report — exact format

Read this when writing Phase 5 artifacts (chat BLUF, full technical table, plain-language report). Templates and rules live here so `SKILL.md` stays the map.

## Findings report — exact format

```
# Code Review — <target> (<FULL|DIFF|FILE>, base <ref>)

## Verdict
<Approve | Approve-with-nits | Changes-requested | Blocked | Partial> — one-line reason.
(`Partial` — a FULL-mode budget checkpoint (`method.md` Phase 0): the coverage
ledger below names which areas are reviewed vs. unreviewed; hand back cleanly
rather than run the lane dry.)
(When the repo has distinct risk surfaces — e.g. a live service plus a disabled
subsystem — give a **two-status verdict**, each scoped: e.g. "🟡 running system ·
🔴 enabling <subsystem>".)
(On a networked target the verdict is **capped below Approve** while any
data-bearing entry point is still listed as untested in `Authz posture` —
unprobed is `unverified`, not clean.)
(On a UI/parity target the verdict is **capped below Approve** while any in-scope
screen is still `unverified` in the correspondence table (`migration-parity.md`) — **or
while no correspondence table exists at all**, since an absent table is *total* absence
of coverage, not coverage. An unrendered screen is an unprobed surface, `unverified`,
not matched. A parity or
completion claim **generalized past the screens actually inspected** is a **High**
communication defect: unlike a hedged ⚠️ that tells the owner to keep checking, a false
"the product matches" tells them to **stop**.)
Counts: Blocker N · Critical N · High N · Medium N · Low N · Nit N

## Ground truth
- Reviewed at (`START_SHA`): <the SHA every finding resolves at — the same pin the
  invariant rows use (`file:line`@`START_SHA` below); a later session re-checks each
  finding against this before repeating it (`method.md`). A machine report
  (`machine-report.md`) records the same pin as its `start_sha` field.>
- Build: <ok / failed: …>
- Tests: <X/Y pass, Z skipped, coverage — scoped per subtree if any gate
  excludes code, e.g. `root: N (excludes X)` + `X: M (separate gate)`>
- Host CI (base <ref>): <pass | FAIL: <job> › <step> (run <id>) | NO_CI |
  unverified: no forge auth>
- Gate scope & self-test: <what the gates exclude; each gate proven red on a
  planted defect incl. empty/whitespace config where applicable, or
  `unverified`/skipped with reason — skip caps self-test only>
- Lint/type/scan: <results>
- Authz posture: <N entry points · anon probed N · cross-account M · untested: …>
- Threat model: <sensitive rows N · open threats N · residual lines N, or `no new boundary (evidence: …)`, or N/A> (`threat-modeling.md`)
- Parity coverage: <N/M screens verified · unverified: …, or N/A> (UI/parity target;
  the correspondence table's row states, `migration-parity.md`)
- Pipeline/app run: <before-state metrics, or N/A>
- Coverage ledger (`Partial` verdict only): <reviewed: domains done · unreviewed:
  domains + budget spent at stop, e.g. `75%/80% cap` — required non-empty on `Partial`>

## Findings
| ID | Sev | Area | Location | Issue | Impact | Fix |
|----|-----|------|----------|-------|--------|-----|
| F1 | Critical | Security/A05 | api/users.py:88 | SQL built by string concat | SQLi, full DB read | Parameterize / bound params |

## Detailed findings (Blocker / Critical / High only)
### F1 — <title>  [Critical]
- Where: <file:line>
- What: <precise description>
- Why it matters: <impact / exploit / wrong result>
- Evidence: <failing case, query plan, repro, or the offending snippet>
- Fix: <smallest correct change; root-cause where possible> — mark
  `mechanism-unproven` when the failure was never reproduced under your control
  (CI-only, intermittent, environment-specific), and name what would prove it (the
  failing seed, the constrained repro, the assertion that fails red first).

**The same evidence bar extends to status reporting, not only fix-closure.**
"N agents are working on this" or "should be fixed now," said before any lane
has produced a verified, green result, overstates progress the same way a
`mechanism-unproven` fix would if reported as simply "fixed." A task is
*running* until it has a green PR, a passing test you personally ran, or a
browser-verified change — report that state honestly, not as progress toward
done. Completion language ("fixed", "done", "shipped") with no citation (a PR
link, a run URL, a commit SHA, a screenshot) in the same message is the smell.

**A status names its evidence surface and holds at its strongest reading.** A
✅ / "done" / "exact" / "matches" / "verified" that the author can immediately
qualify is **downgraded** to the honest weaker status (⚠️ / partial / ❌) — never
a green label sitting beside a caveat ("caveat-exact isn't exact") — when a target
genuinely has two distinct risk surfaces, use the **scoped two-status verdict**
above rather than one green label with a footnote. And a status
names the **surface** its evidence came from; for a UI / product parity claim the
canonical surface is the **default served state** a user lands on (signed-out /
no-role / default route / local default), not only a mock or a hand-picked state
(`rendered-parity.md`). **When more than one tree can serve the app** — the
normal agent topology, each write lane in its own worktree while a human runs a dev
server from a different (often dirty) checkout — "the default served state" silently
means *whichever process holds the port*, not the tree that contains the change, and
a claim can be literally true about the author's tree and false on every surface a
human can open. So a parity claim names the **running instance built from the tree
under review**, identified by **URL + branch + sha actually rendered** (the
`VERIFY_SURFACE` field, `SKILL.md`). A parity claim carrying **no URL and no sha of
the rendered tree is invalid — not downgraded to ⚠️**, because nothing was named to
downgrade. And **never direct a human to a URL whose served sha you have not just
confirmed** — confirm it the way `infra-iac-containers.md` confirms a deploy (#182),
by fetching a byte only the new build serves, not by assuming a rebuild happened. And
for a UI claim the **surface and the inspection are both required**: a screenshot is
the *artifact* (a render happened), the cited **pixel-defect checklist** is the
*evidence* (`ux-gates.md` gate 1 — overlap / clip / contrast /
disabled-looks-disabled). `✅ route X verified — screenshot attached` with **no
cited inspection** is downgraded to ⚠️/`unverified` — the image alone is read as a
verification it is not.

**Name the procedure, not just the surface — different procedures produce different
true results.** A UI-**behaviour** claim ("focus works," "the menu opens on hover")
names the **interaction method** (native keyboard / pointer / scripted DOM call /
assistive-tech command) and the **exact viewport** (width × height), alongside the
route/state and sha — because each changes the result: scripted `focus()` at a
320px-tall viewport and native `Tab` at a full viewport are **different experiments**,
and both verdicts can be true at once. Two results **contradict only when method,
viewport, and route/state match**; when they differ the result is **method-sensitive**,
resolved by a controlled follow-up that changes **one variable at a time** — never picking
a winner to *explain the discrepancy*, though once the variable is isolated, principle 2's
*canonical instrument* decides which experiment answers the user's real question (for
keyboard access, native `Tab`, not a scripted `focus()` a user never calls).
"Focus checked — 26 routes fail" and "Tab works — 196 clean stops" are not a
contradiction to argue for hours; they are two experiments nobody labelled. And an
**absence** claim names the **search space** it covered (which idioms/encodings were
tried) plus the runtime confirmation behind it; an absence naming neither is
`unverified`, not a gap (`method.md`, *presence and absence are not the same claim*).

**Beware the proxy.** A passing test, a green build, a merged PR, or a
hand-configured render is a **proxy** for the user's outcome, not the outcome —
verifying the proxy and asserting the user-facing result is the specific move to
refuse; the proxy is evidence about the proxy. Several proxies recur. In UI-parity
work: a **structure / DOM-order or section-presence match** (a proxy for how it
*renders*), and a surface you **reconfigured to satisfy the check** (switching the
default persona / seed / flag, then verifying "the default" — a proxy for the
served surface). Two more bite the moment a **framework boundary** or **subjective
quality** is in play: a **green typecheck / unit suite for a surface that only
truly renders across a server/client (or SSR/CSR, build/run) split** — the unit
imports the module in the non-boundary context where the value is real, so it
passes while the boundary silently proxies that value away at render
(`frontend-a11y.md`, server/client boundary); and **merge-state /
all-subtasks-green / structural-match standing in for subjective quality** — a gate
proves the code did not regress a *known assertion*, never that a UX is good to
use, so for UI/UX work the bar is the **felt, in-flow experience** exercised across
the real screens (navigation, consistency, density, motion), and a "done" keyed to
a proxy over-claims (before you call it: have I used this the way the user will,
across the relevant screens — and what would they still call poor?). So a
completion status carries a
**one-line record — (surface · default-state observed · reference/spec checked
against) — and states what was *not* checked** in the same breath. A heuristic
checker for the "✅ that needs an asterisk" ships at
`scripts/validate_status_claims.py` (`--file <status-table>`): it flags a positive
status co-occurring with a hedge and no downgrade marker, and — on a second detector
— a positive status whose row also carries parity vocabulary (parity / renders /
restyled / screen / "matches the design") and names **no verification surface** (no
URL, no sha — this half fires even on a downgraded row, since a surfaceless parity
claim is invalid, not downgradable) (exit 1 = candidates to re-check, exit 0 =
clean). A flag is a lead for judgement — downgrade, or split
into a two-status verdict — not an automatic defect. It ships beside the skill and
is copied by `install.sh`.

## Delivering & defending findings — tone, and handling pushback

A finding is read by the human (or agent) whose code it critiques; how it reads matters as much
as whether it is right.

- **Comment on the code, not the author.** State the defect, its impact (*Why it matters*), and
  the smallest fix — never the author's competence or intent ("this is sloppy" → "this `X`
  allows `Y`; fix: `Z`"). A Blocker is a statement about the code's **risk**, not an accusation;
  severity rates **consequence, not blame**. Use "consider / this could" for a genuine
  suggestion, reserve directive language for a real defect, and label a nit `Nit:` so it can't
  read as a gate. (This is register, not vocabulary — `communication-structure` governs shape
  and length, not tone.)
- **When the author disputes a *filed* finding, run a hold-or-concede loop — neither cave nor
  dig in.** (1) Genuinely re-weigh it: if the author is right (the finding is wrong, or the fix
  would break intended behavior a base-ref test pins — the same test as `method.md`'s
  *pre-filing* `REFUTED`, now applied after the finding shipped), **drop it and say so**. (2) If it still stands, **restate the reasoning with more evidence** (the repro, the
  `file:line`, the failing case) and **hold the severity** — a real Blocker does not become a Nit
  under pressure (severity is set by consequence and the principle calibration, not by who
  pushed back). (3) Stay civil regardless. (4) If genuinely deadlocked, **escalate to a named
  path** (owner / maintainer / a *Decisions needed (owner)* entry) and **record the resolution**
  so a later reader sees why it went the way it did — a rationale that lives only in a review
  thread should become a code comment or a doc. Reflexive concession (a green review that buried
  a real risk to avoid friction) and reflexive digging-in (holding a refuted finding on ego) are
  **both** failures.

## Invariants verified to hold (affirmative — co-equal with Findings)
| Invariant | Where proven | What proves it | Confidence |
|-----------|--------------|----------------|------------|
| Tenant selection is JWT-`sub`-only; no body/query/header can select a tenant | api/mw/tenant.ts:31 | anon-GET → 401 and two-principal swap → 403; no untrusted tenant source in the loader | CONFIRMED |
(Primary deliverable on a hardened target — not "we found nothing" but the specific
properties opened and proven. Each row grounded at `file:line`@`START_SHA` with the
same snippet-or-drop rigor a finding gets; drop any you cannot quote. Coverage —
finder id + lead-read — reconciled per Phase 5.)

## Quality delta (if the pipeline ran)
| Metric | Before | After (if fixed) | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Dedup rate / Fill rate / Records | … | … | |

## Branch & merge triage (FULL / repo-level review with open branches; else N/A)
Detected model: <trunk-based | GitHub flow | GitLab flow | git-flow> → target <main|develop>.
Coverage: <N local + M remote branches; PR state via gh | unverified: no forge auth>.
| Branch | Last commit | State | Unique commits | Open PR | Recommendation | Command |
|--------|-------------|-------|----------------|---------|----------------|---------|
| feature/x | 3 days ago | unmerged, ready | 4 | none | Open PR → develop | gh pr create -B develop -H feature/x |

_One illustrative row only — the canonical column shape, the `0*`/`unverified` footnote, and the full worked example live in `branch-and-merge-hygiene.md` § Triage table; do not duplicate them here._
(Routine cleanup batched here as one Low/Info finding; consequence branches —
unmerged security fix, only-copy work — escalated in the findings table above.)

## Decisions needed (owner)
- <question> — needs <role/owner>.  (Includes any design-altering a11y/UX change.)

## What's good
- <brief; what to keep / what was done right>

## Going-forward roadmap (stage-calibrated; not a second findings table)
Sequence the findings **already listed above** by what to do for the current
`STAGE` — an ordering, never a copy:
- **Now (blocks at this stage):** <finding IDs whose severity gates here>.
- **Next (before the next stage):** <IDs tracked now, due as the project matures>.
- **Skillset to adopt going forward:** run `./install.sh --recommend <target>` and
  name the overlays it returns (delivery / critic / comms / contribution) — point,
  don't restate. Whether the repo is ready for an agent to work in it well:
  `role-coverage.md`'s agent-readiness lens.
- **Infra & docs evolution for the next stage:** what the project's infrastructure/architecture and
  documentation should become at its next stage — `infra-evolution-by-stage.md` and
  `docs-evolution-by-stage.md` (the stage-evolution inputs `SKILL.md` routes here).
- **Development direction (grounded in the code):** ≤ 3 evidence-backed moves for
  this stage — e.g. "consolidate the three half-built features before adding a
  fourth", "set module boundaries now if the team is about to grow" — each citing
  a `file:line` or a named signal. Anything needing market, financial, or org
  context the repo cannot evidence goes under **Decisions needed (owner)**, not
  invented here.

## Standards imprint (Phase 6, if opted in)
- <what was added/merged into AGENTS.md (and peer pointers) / gates / templates,
  or "not requested">

## Human-readable report (default out-of-tree; in-repo on request)

Alongside the machine-actionable report above, produce a **plain-language report a
non-technical reader can act on**. It goes out-of-tree by default (`~/Downloads/`,
session scratch, or the PR comment); on the user's explicit request — and only on
an unshared, idle checkout — write it into a top-level `code-review/` directory
(create it if absent) so it is easy to find from the repo root, using a dated file
plus an index so history is preserved and nothing is overwritten. On a public
remote, apply Phase 5's disclosure limit: IDs, severities, and areas only. A
worked fictional example (machine + plain-language, with `CORROBORATED` /
`latent`) lives in `docs/example-review-report.md` in the skill repository, copied
to `references/example-review-report.md` by `install.sh`.

- `code-review/README.md` — index: one line per review (date · verdict · link).
- `code-review/review-YYYY-MM-DD.md` — the report for this run.

This output is additive and reversible (a new dated file); it never edits code.
Keep the language jargon-free — explain each risk as *what could happen*, not as
a CWE number — and link each item to its technical finding ID so an engineer can
jump to the detail. Relative links in this file resolve **from `code-review/`**
(e.g. `../docs/x.md`), and a new top-level dir must satisfy any doc-link gate.
Scrub **third-party proper nouns** too (public event/conference/product names are
usually not on a derived deny-set, so they pass the privacy gate but still leak
context) — keep committed findings generic. **Branch names and PR titles are an
identifier vector** — real ones carry client names, ticket IDs, and personal
prefixes (`feature/acme-integration`, `jane/wip-payroll`); generalize them in the
committed report (`feature/<redacted>`, "the client-integration branch") and keep
the raw branch/PR triage in the session output, which is not committed. After
writing, run the project's privacy/name gate over this file (Phase 5).

Template for `code-review/review-YYYY-MM-DD.md`:

```
# Code review — <project>, <date>

## In one line
<🟢 Healthy | 🟡 Needs attention | 🔴 Not ready to ship> — <one plain sentence>.
<If the project has two risk surfaces (e.g. what runs today vs. a switched-off
part), give one status for each — e.g. "🟡 what runs today · 🔴 before turning on
<the part>".>

## What this project does
<one short paragraph in plain language: the problem it solves and how>

## Health at a glance
| Area | Status | In plain words |
|---|---|---|
| Security | 🟢/🟡/🔴 | <e.g. "Strangers cannot reach other people's data" or "…they can — fix first"> |
| Correctness | 🟢/🟡/🔴 | <does it produce the right results?> |
| Data quality | 🟢/🟡/🔴 | <is the data real, and never overwritten with something worse?> |
| Speed & cost | 🟢/🟡/🔴 | <fast enough, and not paying for repeated/needless work?> |
| Reliability | 🟢/🟡/🔴 | <does it recover from errors without losing or corrupting data?> |
| Tests | 🟢/🟡/🔴 | <is it checked automatically so a change can't quietly break it?> |
| Documentation | 🟢/🟡/🔴 | <can a new person understand, set up, and run it?> |

## The most important things to fix (plain language)
1. **<plain-language title>** — what could go wrong, in human terms, and why it
   matters. *(Technical detail: F1.)*
2. …

## What's already good
- <what to keep — credit the things done right>

## What to do next (for where this project is)
<plain language: the 1-3 things worth doing now for a <prototype / mvp / growth /
mature> project, and what can safely wait until it grows — so the effort matches
the stage instead of over-building a prototype or under-hardening a live product.
Anything needing your business judgement is under "Decisions we need from you".>

## Open work to tidy up (if there are leftover branches)
<plain language: how many unfinished/leftover branches exist, and what should
happen — e.g. "8 are already merged and safe to remove; 1 holds an unfinished fix
that was never shipped; 1 exists only on one machine and should be backed up." A
short "clean up / finish / decide" list, not the technical commands.>

## Decisions we need from you
- <owner decision — includes any fix that would noticeably change the current
  look/design, so you can point to a style guide or say it's a prototype>

## If nothing is fixed
<the practical risk in one or two sentences — data loss, a breach, a growing
bill, users blocked>

## How to read this
🟢 fine · 🟡 improve soon · 🔴 fix before shipping. The full technical report,
with exact file locations and fixes, is in <the findings above / the PR / link>.
