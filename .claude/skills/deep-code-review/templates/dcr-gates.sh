#!/usr/bin/env bash
# dcr-gates.sh — run the INSTALLED deep-code-review skill's own gate scripts
# in THIS repo's CI (or locally). Copied verbatim by `install.sh --with-gates`
# to <target>/scripts/dcr-gates.sh; never modified by the installer once
# copied — edit it in place if this project's test-glob or allowlist needs
# differ from the defaults below.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS: the skillset's mechanisms (fix_class_gate.py,
# binaries_gate.py, and friends) only enforce anything inside the
# deep-code-review repository's own CI. A project that installs the skill
# gets the doctrine as prose an agent may or may not follow, and the
# mechanism itself never runs here. This script is the opt-in bridge:
# `install.sh --with-gates` + `.github/workflows/dcr-gates.yml` wires it into
# this repo's CI so the same enforcement fires on every push/PR.
#
# ONE IMPLEMENTATION — no duplicated gate logic. Every check below calls a
# script living INSIDE the installed skill tree (resolved dynamically below);
# this file only resolves paths and wires exit codes together. Upgrading the
# skill (re-running install.sh) upgrades the checks this file runs, with zero
# edits here.
#
# Configuration (env vars, all optional):
#   DCR_TEST_GLOBS         space-separated globs a fix commit's test-surface
#                           touch must match (passed to fix_class_gate.py
#                           --test-glob, once per glob, as literal patterns —
#                           never expanded against this directory). Unset ->
#                           the script's own defaults (tests/** etc; see its
#                           --help).
#   DCR_TRIGGER_GLOBS      space-separated globs (literal patterns, as
#                           above). Set -> fix_class_gate.py runs a second
#                           time in trigger mode on the same range: a commit
#                           touching a matching path must also touch a
#                           DCR_TEST_GLOBS path or carry a non-empty
#                           No-Mechanism-Reason: trailer. Unset -> skipped.
#   DCR_BINARIES_ALLOWLIST path to the binaries-gate allowlist file. Unset ->
#                           <repo-root>/scripts/binaries-allowlist.tsv if it
#                           exists, else no exemptions.
#   BASE_SHA / HEAD_SHA     the commit range fix_class_gate.py (and the
#                           opt-in refix_gate.py) checks. In CI, set these
#                           from the event (see the shipped workflow
#                           template). Locally, defaults to HEAD~1..HEAD when
#                           both are unset.
