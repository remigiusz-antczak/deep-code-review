# Retrospective — G10 Learn, made real

Read this when running G10, or when a target's own incident/postmortem
practice is in scope for a review. `SKILL.md`'s G10 row is one line —
"Retrospective. Escaped gap → regression test in this repo. Reusable lesson is
generalized..." — this file is the discipline behind it: when a retrospective
is mandatory (not every bug fix), what it must contain, and the gate that
keeps an action item from quietly dying.

## Blameless — the principle the rest depends on

A postmortem assumes everyone involved had good intentions and acted on the
information they had at the time. Findings point at systems and processes,
never at a person: a blame culture teaches people not to bring issues to
light for fear of punishment, and you cannot "fix" a person the way you can
fix a system. State this explicitly at the top of every postmortem — it is
the reason people write the honest timeline instead of the defensible one.

## Mandatory-trigger criteria — not every bug fix

The existing "regression test first" rule already covers an ordinary bug. A
written postmortem is required when at least one of these fired:

- user-visible downtime or degradation past a stated threshold;
- any data loss;
- on-call/human intervention was required (rollback, traffic reroute, a
  manual fix);
- resolution time exceeded a stated threshold;
- the problem was found by a person, not by monitoring (a detection failure
  is itself a finding — see Detection below);
- a stakeholder asked for one anyway.

Below that bar, the existing "escaped gap → regression test" line is
sufficient; do not manufacture postmortem ceremony for a routine fix.

## Shape — the vendored template

`template-postmortem.md` in this skill's `references/` ships the full section
order: Summary, Impact (quantified — "some users noticed issues" is not
impact), Root Cause(s) (plural; list every contributing cause, don't collapse
to one for narrative neatness), Trigger (the technical event that activated
the root cause), Resolution (including what was tried and did **not** work),
Detection (how it was noticed — a missing alert that should have fired is a
finding), Action Items (owner + tracking reference required), Lessons Learned
(what went well / what went poorly / where we got lucky — don't let luck get
filed as margin), Timeline, Supporting information.

## Action-item closure — the gate that makes this more than a document

An action item with no owner or no tracking reference is not done — it is a
sentence that will be forgotten. Every item in the table carries a named owner
and a bug/issue reference; `In progress`/`Open` items are re-checked at the
next retrospective touching the same area, not left to rot.

## Repeat-root-cause check

Before closing a postmortem, check whether its root cause matches an earlier
one. If it does and no new regression test, alert, or gate was added since the
earlier incident, the missing safeguard **is** the finding — name which
regression test, alert, or gate should have existed and did not. This is the
same "gate proven red on a planted defect" discipline this skill already
applies to code, applied to incident causes: a recurring root cause with
nothing new added between occurrences means nothing was actually learned the
first time.

## Cross-reference — the reliability contract this feeds

`role-coverage.md`'s Platform/DevOps/SRE lens (`deep-code-review` skill) owns
SLI/SLO/error-budget/burn-rate — multiwindow, multi-burn-rate alerting so a
fast burn pages and a slow burn tickets. A postmortem's Detection section is
where that alerting is judged after the fact: did the burn-rate alert that
should have caught this actually fire, and if not, why not.

## Gate, trigger, planted-defect test

- **Gate:** a postmortem exists with every section filled, every action item
  owned and tracked, and a matching-root-cause check against prior
  postmortems. **Trigger:** the mandatory criteria above — not every bug fix.
  **Owning hat:** Conductor or Release (G10 is post-hoc and cross-cutting).
- **Planted-defect test 1:** an action item with no owner and no tracking
  reference → the gate flags it.
- **Planted-defect test 2:** a second postmortem citing the same root cause as
  an earlier one, with no new regression test or gate referenced since → the
  gate flags "repeat cause, no new gate."
