# Incident response & continuity — the "on fire OR gone" binder

**Read this when** drafting an incident runbook, defining severity levels or
status/comms templates, setting up a break-glass access path, building a
credential/renewal inventory with reminders, or writing a solo-operator
succession note. This is the operational-readiness lens over the delivery OS:
the binder that has to exist *before* either failure mode arrives.

Two failure modes, one root cause — **bus factor = 1**:

- **The system is on fire.** An outage, a breach, data loss, a runaway agent.
- **The operator is gone.** Illness, a two-week absence, or worse — with
  nothing written down, the lights go out.

Neither can be authored during the event. Draft them cold.

## Boundary (what this lens does and does not do)

- **In scope:** *draft* the runbooks, templates, inventory, and the succession
  note. Structure the response.
- **Out of scope — route, never assert:**
  - **Who and when to notify on a breach** (customers, regulators, authorities)
    is a regulated-domain question. It routes to **G2 regulated-domain triage +
    legal counsel**. Notification clocks vary by jurisdiction and data type;
    this lens never states a specific deadline as fact — it points to counsel.
  - **Executing** any breach notification, or any succession/estate action, is
    the **owner's** call, taken with the relevant professional.
- **No fabrication.** Do not invent an SLA number, a legal deadline, a breach
  count, or a renewal date. Unknown timing is `UNVERIFIED` and routed; a date
  you cannot confirm is left blank for the owner to fill.

## Incident runbook

Six phases. Record timestamps and decisions as you go — that log *is* the
postmortem input.

1. **Detect.** How the incident is noticed (alert, report, anomaly). If it was
   noticed by a customer before any monitor, that gap is itself a finding for
   the review phase. Point detection design at the observability lens in
   `deep-code-review` — do not restate it here.
2. **Triage.** Assign a severity (below). Name a single incident lead (even a
   solo operator states "I am lead" to separate the role from the panic).
   Start the incident log.
3. **Contain.** Stop the bleeding before understanding it fully — take the
   feature offline, revoke a key, rate-limit, roll back. Containment beats a
   perfect diagnosis while harm accrues. Prefer a reversible containment.
4. **Eradicate.** Find and remove the root cause, not just the symptom. If the
   cause is a code defect, it goes through the normal review gate before the fix
   ships — an emergency does not suspend `deep-code-review`; it may narrow its
   scope to the diff.
5. **Recover.** Restore normal service. Verify the restore actually worked
   (see restore drills) rather than assuming. Watch for recurrence before
   declaring the incident closed.
6. **Review.** A **blameless** postmortem. Do not re-author the format — reuse
   `template-postmortem.md` and the mandatory-trigger / action-item-closure gate
   in `retrospective.md`. An escaped gap becomes a regression test; a reusable,
   identifier-stripped lesson can go upstream via the `contribution` overlay.

## Severity levels (template — owner sets the thresholds)

Fill these in for the specific product; the tiers below are a starting frame,
not asserted standards. Each tier defines: impact, who is paged, and how often
status is updated.

| Sev | Impact (example — set your own) | Response |
|---|---|---|
| SEV1 | Full outage, data loss, active breach | Drop everything; continuous updates |
| SEV2 | Major feature down, degraded for many | Same-day; regular updates |
| SEV3 | Minor or single-user, workaround exists | Normal queue; note and schedule |

## Comms templates

Honesty over polish. Never publish a fabricated ETA or a cause you have not
confirmed — "we are investigating" is truthful; a made-up root cause is not.

- **Internal update:** what is affected · severity · current action · next
  update time.
- **External / status page:** plain-language impact · that you are on it ·
  when the next update lands — no invented ETA, no blame, no minimization.
  A public status page (even a single static page you can flip) beats silence.
- **Breach comms are different:** their *content and timing* are gated by
  counsel + G2. Draft the mechanism now; do not pre-write a legal notice.

## Break-glass access

Emergency elevated access for when the normal path is down or the normal
approver is unreachable:

- **Pre-authorized and documented** before the emergency — not improvised.
- **Least privilege, time-boxed** — the narrowest access that resolves the
  incident, expiring automatically.
- **Logged and reviewed after.** Every break-glass use is a postmortem item:
  why the normal path failed, and whether the access should have been that
  broad.
- For a solo operator, "break-glass" also means: can a *trusted second person*
  get in at all if you cannot? If the answer is no, that is a bus-factor
  finding (see succession).

## Credential & renewal inventory (with dead-man reminders)

An expired domain, TLS cert, or card silently takes the product down with no
outage to detect. Maintain an inventory the owner keeps current:

| Item | Where it lives | Renews / expires | Reminder lead | Rotation / renewal steps |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Domain registration | | | | |
| TLS / SSL certificate(s) | | | | |
| Payment card on file (for infra/domains) | | | | |
| DNS provider account | | | | |
| API keys / secrets (rotation cadence) | | | | |
| Cloud / hosting account | | | | |

- **Dead-man, not single-calendar.** A reminder on one person's calendar dies
  with bus-factor 1. Prefer a reminder that fires on a schedule *and* is visible
  to a second party, or that requires an explicit "still handled" acknowledgment
  and escalates if none comes.
- **Automate expiry checks where possible** (cert/domain expiry monitors) so a
  lapse is caught before it bites.
- Leave real dates blank for the owner to enter. Never populate this table with
  invented dates.

## Restore drills

A backup that has never been restored is not a backup. Point the depth at the
reliability / disaster-recovery lens in `deep-code-review` — do not restate it.
What belongs here is the **schedule**:

- A recurring restore drill (restore from backup into a scratch environment and
  verify integrity), on a cadence the owner sets and records.
- The drill result is logged; a failed drill is an incident.

## VCS history-rewrite incident (a forced-update lands on a protected branch)

**Read this when** a fetch or ref-watcher reports a forced-update on a
protected/integration branch, or before running any destructive VCS operation
(history rewrite, mass force-push, bulk delete).

**Before ANY destructive VCS operation:** name the exact target out loud —
repository `owner/name` (never "the project," never inferred from a vague
brief) and the full ref list being touched — and require a confirmation input
that matches those exact coordinates before running anything. A brief naming
only a vague target ("purge content from version control") is not
authorization to guess which repository or refs it means; a purge meant for
one repo landing on another (#1138) is exactly this gap.

1. **Detect.** A forced-update on a protected or integration branch (a fetch,
   a ref-watcher, or a merge-base that jumped backward) is an incident signal,
   not a normal update — enter this runbook at Triage.
2. **Freeze — ALL pushes, not just merge/rebase.** Broadcast a HOLD before
   investigating: no push, rebase, merge, force-push, or new branch cut from
   the integration branch, **including a lane's own branch**. A HOLD that
   forbids only the integration branch still lets an own-branch push land
   after the rewrite, and that branch falls outside the pre-rewrite mirror
   step 4 restores from — own-branch pushes are exactly what the first
   broadcast of this kind got wrong once already. Lanes keep committing
   locally; pushes resume per branch only after the restore owner's GO.
   Mechanize the freeze rather than trust the broadcast alone: drop a HOLD
   marker file naming the reason in the git common dir (`git rev-parse
   --git-common-dir`), and configure your pre-push hook to refuse every push
   while that marker exists — a broadcast alone lets a lane push before it
   reads the channel.
3. **Attribute with local evidence, not the host.** A shared hosting account
   makes the host's event log useless for attribution. On each machine: check
   the reflog for `update by push` on the protected refs, and look for
   rewrite-tool traces (`.git/filter-repo/`, an installed rewrite binary).
4. **Backup mirror, before restoring anything.** `git clone --mirror` the
   current (post-incident) state of every affected repo to a scratch path —
   even though it may hold the bad rewrite, it is the only complete record of
   what the forge served at incident time, and a later well-meant push can
   overwrite objects a subsequent step needs.
5. **Restore per branch — a ledger, not a blanket rebase.** Classify every
   branch by its base against a pre-rewrite mirror (a `--mirror` clone taken
   *before* the incident, or the last trusted backup):
   - **PRE** — base is still an ancestor of the branch: `git rebase
     <restored-base> <branch>` (plain).
   - **REWRITTEN** — the branch's base was rewritten under it: `git rebase
     --onto <restored-base> <rewritten-base> <branch>`.
   - **TIP-REWRITTEN** — an open PR's own head was rewritten server-side:
     `git rebase --onto <restored-remote-tip> <rewritten-tip> <branch>`.

   Skip any branch an active lane still owns — restoring under a running lane
   corrupts its worktree; wait for it to park first. For every branch actually
   restored: `git push --force-with-lease=<branch>:<fetched-bad-sha> <remote>
   <restored-sha>:<branch>`, then verify the ref (`surface_check.py ref`,
   above). On a `--force-with-lease` rejection, abort that branch, report it,
   and move to the next — never retry with a plain `--force`.
   `.claude/skills/agentic-delivery/scripts/restore_ledger.py` classifies refs
   mechanically from a mirror plus the current remote state and prints each
   row with its suggested command; it never pushes.
6. **Forge objects often survive the rewrite.** Before re-uploading anything
   from the mirror, check whether the forge's own object store still holds the
   pre-rewrite commits (a rewrite that only moved refs, not one that
   garbage-collected — common in a short window); a ref-update API call
   restoring the old sha can then skip a full re-push entirely.
7. **Prevent it.**
   - A destructive history tool confirms repository identity (remote URL
     **and** a repo-specific marker, not name alone) before running — the
     `owner/name` + full-ref-list confirmation above, made mechanical.
   - Server-side branch protection against force-push on every integration
     branch, wherever the plan allows it; where it doesn't, the pre-push
     HOLD-marker hook in step 2 is the only defence.

## Solo-operator succession note

The "if the operator is gone" half of the binder. Drafting it is in scope;
the legal/estate dimension is the owner's, with a professional.

- **A trusted second person** and how they are reached.
- **Where everything is:** accounts, the credential inventory above, the
  repos, the infra, the domain — and how that person gains access (ties to
  break-glass).
- **Keep-the-lights-on vs graceful-wind-down:** the minimum to keep the
  product alive for a defined window, and how to shut it down cleanly and
  honestly notify users if that is the call.
- **Boundary:** this note is operational continuity, not a will or a legal
  instrument. Anything with legal force → owner + counsel.

## Verification

- A planted expired or about-to-expire credential/renewal in the inventory is
  surfaced (flagged for action), not passed over.
- A restore-drill schedule is present (a cadence, not just "we have backups").
- Breach notification timing is **routed** to G2 + counsel — never asserted as
  a specific deadline here.
- The review phase reuses `template-postmortem.md` rather than a second format.
- A forced-update on a protected branch runs Detect → Freeze (ALL pushes,
  including own-branch) → Attribute → Backup mirror → per-branch Restore
  ledger, in that order — never a restore attempted before the freeze lands.
- A destructive VCS operation names `owner/name` and the full ref list, and
  waits on a confirmation input matching those exact coordinates, before
  running.
