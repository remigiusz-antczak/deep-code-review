# Host capability & enforcement contract

**Read this when** claiming that state, permissions, or spend are *enforced*
rather than merely followed, briefing a worktree-isolated write-lane, or
designing a host adapter for this overlay.
A claim-honesty framework plus an optional interface: **no sandbox, budget
service, or durable runtime ships here** (only the two scripts named below). It
applies `SKILL.md` principle 3 (a check that could not run is `UNVERIFIED`,
never a pass) to the coordination layer itself.

## Claim only the level you observed

Three levels, and a markdown instruction or an unused example hook never reaches
the third:

| Level | What supports the claim | What it cannot establish |
|---|---|---|
| **Protocol** | The agent follows the skill and records its decisions/receipts | Cannot itself prevent bypass, lost state, a forbidden action, or overspend |
| **Validated artifact** | A named validator checks a specific schema/invariant against a pinned artifact, and its actual result is recorded | Shape validity is not receipt truth, live behaviour, or action authorization |
| **Host-enforced** | A tested adapter intercepts the real action boundary and denies disallowed actions using policy/state the worker cannot edit | Covers only the tested events/actions/host versions; other paths stay protocol-only |

Declare capability **per control** (state, permission, spend, isolation, model
choice, tool/capability access, receipt capture), not once for a whole host. Record host + version, the
date observed, the level, the probe evidence, and the paths still unsupported. A
skill directory, a model name, a worktree, or a hook *example* is not evidence of
enforcement. Probe the actual tool/auth/model-control availability; label
inherited or unavailable controls as such, and **fail or narrow the dependent
action when a required control is absent** — never convert an unavailable check
into a pass or into authority.

A prompt-level "do not use tool X" is a **protocol** control only — instructions are not a sandbox.
The **host-enforced** form spawns the worker with an allowed-tools set that excludes X (or denies it
at the execution boundary); the protocol fallback audits the receipt's tool calls afterward. Declare
tool access at the level you can enforce; narrow the dependent action when only the prompt exists.

## Isolated write-lanes: guard first, stop at the first refusal

Isolation is a control too: a lane that lost it writes a shared tree. A write-lane brief's first
command is `git rev-parse HEAD && python3 .claude/skills/agentic-delivery/scripts/lane_guard.py
--expect-branch <branch>` — the direct read probes any command-wrapping hook; `lane_guard.py`
(`--selftest`) requires `--expect-branch` (`--allow-any-branch` waives it, never in a lane brief),
prints one quotable `LANE_GUARD REFUSE:` line and exits non-zero unless the cwd is a linked worktree
on exactly that branch and it is not a default one (origin/HEAD's target, `main`, `master`, or the
main checkout's branch). At that refusal, or any later git or file-write refusal, the lane stops and
hands back the line plus its changed files; any other missing control narrows only the dependent
action (above). The brief names the dodges as out of bounds, own branch
included: an absolute binary path, a wrapper (`env`, `sh -c`, a script), a subshell — all
permission-laundering (`multi-session-coordination.md`). The orchestrator audits live processes
(`pgrep -fl 'git push'`), not only lane reports. Without host isolation, the orchestrator makes each
worktree (`git worktree add`) and spawns the lane there, confined by the brief; blocked work is
re-shipped by a fresh lane in a fresh worktree, never salvaged via git in the blocked tree. Each
receipt records its isolation mode (host / orchestrator-worktree).

## Optional adapter interface (proposed, not shipped)

If a host exposes the events, an adapter normalizes only those it actually has;
missing events stay explicit gaps.

| Event | Required adapter behaviour |
|---|---|
| Session start / resume / checkpoint | Load and write the project record (`project-state.md`); reconcile live owners and unknown effects before admitting any retry |
| Task dispatch / completion | Bind owner, scope, dependencies, and budget; capture the real tool/artifact receipt separately from the worker's own summary |
| Before a paid or consequential action | Check current authority, required evidence, state revision, and the resource bound; reserve capacity atomically before admitting the action |
| Result / failure / cancellation | Observe the actual result and usage; reconcile the reservation; record pending/unknown effects; keep failed-attempt costs |
| Objective / permission change | Invalidate affected queued work and stale grants; cancel where supported and reconcile in-flight effects |

Reservations must cover outstanding work **plus** the next permitted call
(tool/provider charges included); deny admission if the bound cannot hold. An
estimate with no bounded call or stop mechanism is not a hard cap. A cancellation
*request* is not proof of cancellation — hold the reservation for unknown or
in-flight charges until the status is observed, and record overshoot honestly.
Replay must deduplicate by event identity while re-checking permission afresh: a
duplicate receipt must never bill or publish twice.

Protect policy, grants, counters, and receipt sources from the worker they
constrain; scope credentials at the real execution boundary — ordinary worktree
isolation and model instructions are **not** a security sandbox. For every
receipt, name its trust boundary (a provider/runner observation versus the
agent's own assertion).

**Before raising a claim to host-enforced,** exercise allow/deny,
malformed/stale events, replay, crash-after-effect, cancellation, revoked
authorization, and missing-hook cases, and record the observed result for that
host version and covered path. Downgrade the claim where support is missing;
never assert a cross-host conformance result you did not observe.

## Subagent handback: fields-only, mechanically capped (a Host-enforced instance)

Chat narration a subagent hands back to its caller is billed output nobody
re-reads — `fanout-host-sizing.md`'s cost argument, made a **hook** here
instead of a prompt instruction alone (a prompt-level "keep it short" stays
Protocol above, never Host-enforced). The cap is on **chat narration only**:
deliverables (code, reports, long findings) go in files, which are
uncapped — a compliant handback names the file path instead of pasting its
content into chat. **The default handback is one line:** `status | evidence |
next` (verdict; branch/SHA, gate results, or file paths as the checkable
evidence; the next action or open issue) — key=value or short fields, never
prose. **No polling.** Never sleep/loop waiting on background work in a
subagent turn — end the turn and let the notification resume it; a poll loop
bills chat narration nobody reads, the same waste this cap targets. The 800-char/10-line hook below is the **backstop** that catches a
drift back to narration; it is not itself the target shape, and passing it
is not a substitute for actually being one line. The orchestrator never
relays a subagent's prose; it reads the fields and the named files.

Install (`SubagentStop`; no `matcher` runs on every agent, a `matcher` scopes
it to named agent types):

```json
"hooks": {
  "SubagentStop": [
    { "hooks": [{ "type": "command",
        "command": "python3 .claude/skills/agentic-delivery/scripts/handback_cap.py" }] }
  ]
}
```

`scripts/handback_cap.py` — **use this when** a subagent's chat handback is
landing in an orchestrator's context uncapped. Stdlib-only; blocks (exit 2,
which per the host's docs continues the subagent instead of stopping it, so no
work is lost) a chat handback over 800 chars / 10 lines; exempts only agent
types named in `HANDBACK_EXEMPT_TYPES` (default: 4 built-in types) — it never
inspects tools, so a custom read-only review lane is capped by default too;
releases after 3 blocks per agent so it never loops forever. `--selftest`
proves it fires. Its `VERIFIED`/`UNVERIFIED` status check and the `lane_cap.py` tool-call cap: `cost-quality-guardrails.md` §2.

**A harness with no report file** (a review lane's findings ARE its chat
answer) still needs a cap — never exempt it: exempt means uncapped, which
reopens the cost problem. Raise the cap for that agent type only, via a
second, `matcher`-scoped `SubagentStop` entry with env overrides:

```json
{ "matcher": "security-reviewer", "hooks": [{ "type": "command",
    "command": "HANDBACK_MAX_LINES=25 HANDBACK_MAX_CHARS=2000 python3 .claude/skills/agentic-delivery/scripts/handback_cap.py" }] }
```

## Subagent model + cache-TTL pin (a Host-enforced instance, Claude Code)

A CLAUDE.md line telling every subagent "default to the cheapest tier" is
**Protocol** only — a subagent's own `model:` frontmatter still wins over it.
On Claude Code, `CLAUDE_CODE_SUBAGENT_MODEL` (an alias or model ID) plus
`CLAUDE_CODE_SUBAGENT_MODEL_FORCE=1` in `settings.json`'s `env` block is
**Host-enforced** instead (v2.1.257+): every subagent, teammate, and workflow
agent's `model:` field (built-in Explore and Plan included) is ignored and they
run on the named model; with only `FORCE` set, on the main conversation's
model. Exceptions to declare: a fork, and a skill run in a subagent with
`model: inherit`, still run on the main conversation's model; with only
`FORCE` set, built-in Explore keeps its cap (Opus, on the Claude API).

Cache lifetime is the sibling spend control. Defaults: on a Claude subscription
within plan usage, the main conversation gets `1h` and every other request
(subagents, workflows, teammates, forks, compaction) `5m`, except a few
server-controlled helper requests (`1h`); on usage credits, an API key, or a
cloud provider, both get `5m`. Pins take `5m`/`1h` (v2.1.242+): the main
conversation's `promptCacheTtl` setting / `CLAUDE_CODE_PROMPT_CACHE_TTL` env
var, everything else's `subagentPromptCacheTtl` / `CLAUDE_CODE_SUBAGENT_PROMPT_CACHE_TTL`.
First match wins: `FORCE_PROMPT_CACHING_5M=1` (both buckets) → the bucket's env
var → its setting → a subagent's own `experimental.cacheTtl` frontmatter
(v2.1.248+; `1h` ignored while a subscription is on usage credits) →
`ENABLE_PROMPT_CACHING_1H=1` (both buckets) → the bucket default. The
frontmatter is per-agent (Protocol); the other-requests env/setting pin or
`FORCE_PROMPT_CACHING_5M` overrides it.
Declare which control is set, and its bucket default.

```json
{
  "env": {
    "CLAUDE_CODE_SUBAGENT_MODEL": "haiku",
    "CLAUDE_CODE_SUBAGENT_MODEL_FORCE": "1",
    "CLAUDE_CODE_SUBAGENT_PROMPT_CACHE_TTL": "1h"
  }
}
```

## Per-turn token levers (a Host-enforced instance, Claude Code)

Five `settings.json` keys cut what reaches context every turn — the host
clamps or truncates before Claude ever sees the excess, so a worker cannot
prompt its way past them (Host-enforced by the ladder above). Verified
against `settings-reference.md` / `tools-reference.md`
(`docs/standards-index.md`, 2026-09-23).

| Setting | Saves | Start at | Trade-off |
|---|---|---|---|
| `bashOutputMaxChars` | Inline chars of a *successful* Bash/PowerShell result; unset = ~30,000 inline, clamped 4,000–128,000 (v2.1.261+) | `10000` | Overflow lands in a session-dir file plus a 2,000-char preview — Claude must `Read` it back when it needs the tail |
| `skillListingMaxDescChars` | Chars of each skill's `description`+`when_to_use` resent every turn; default `1536` | `300` | A cut mid-sentence can drop the phrase that would have triggered auto-invocation of a rarely-used skill |
| `skillListingBudgetFraction` | Listing size as a fraction of the context window; default `0.01` (1%); over budget, Claude Code drops descriptions (names survive) of the least-used skills first | keep `0.01` unless 50+ skills are installed | Lower it and fewer full descriptions survive, so Claude self-selects an idle skill less often |
| `skillOverrides` | Whole skill entries — `"name-only"` drops the description, `"user-invocable-only"` hides from Claude but keeps `/name`, `"off"` hides both | `"name-only"` on every skill irrelevant to this project | Miscalled on a skill Claude actually needed, it never self-invokes; only above `"off"` does `/name` still work |
| `subagentPromptCacheTtl` | Cache write/read cost across a subagent's own turns and resumed runs (not the per-turn caps above); unset → `5m` (subagents sit outside the main-conversation bucket even on a subscription) | leave `5m` for one-shot subagents | `1h` writes at the higher cache-write rate — pays off only if that subagent is reused inside the hour, else pure loss |

`CLAUDE_CODE_SUBAGENT_MODEL` (+`_FORCE`) is the sibling model-pin lever —
see "Subagent model + cache-TTL pin" above; not restated here.

```json
{
  "bashOutputMaxChars": 10000,
  "skillListingMaxDescChars": 300,
  "skillOverrides": { "<skill-irrelevant-to-project>": "name-only" },
  "subagentPromptCacheTtl": "5m"
}
```

## Cost discipline: no push/CI spend to "see if it passes"

Run every gate locally, once, before pushing: a push, a re-run, or `gh pr
update-branch` each cost a fresh CI run for zero new signal over what the
local run already showed. Mechanisms, not just prose: `ci_cost_lint.py`
(`deep-code-review/scripts/`) flags a rerun-prone workflow; `token_report.py
--budget` (`agentic-ceo/scripts/`) catches a poll/re-push loop's spend;
`merge_train.py refresh` (`merge-operations.md`) defaults to printing local
merge-and-push commands per PR, never `gh pr update-branch`, unless
`--use-update-branch` opts in (its own help names the one-CI-run-per-PR
cost). `[skip ci]` is never an option on the ref main CI protects (a
required check must actually run to satisfy branch protection); prefer `gh
pr merge --auto` (merges once required checks pass, no polling) over a
watch/poll loop. The one rerun carve-out: at most one same-commit rerun, and
only when the failure log matches a known infrastructure-flake signature
(runner lost, network timeout) — `merge-queue-worktrees.md` **A load-flaky
required gate is not a confirmed red** and `gate-epistemology.md` principle
3 own the mechanics; anything else is fixed, not rerun. None of this blocks
a genuinely new push (a real fix, a rebase after a real conflict) — only the
reflexive re-push/re-run/poll that re-buys a result a local run already
gave.

## Minimum-cost CI & token profile (universal, mandatory)

**Read this when** wiring or reviewing GitHub Actions triggers, sizing a
fleet's per-run spend, or judging whether a "required check" is actually
enforced rather than self-reported. Every control below is declared at the
level the ladder above supports — most of this section is Protocol (a repo
owner configures it; nothing here ships an enforcing adapter), and each
control says so explicitly rather than implying Host-enforced.

**Integration branches** (a `development`/staging branch that isn't the
release target): **zero GitHub-hosted CI.** Server-enforced instead of
trusted — a branch protection rule/ruleset requires PRs and restricts who can
merge/push to the integration branch to **one integrator identity**. That
identity is a **deterministic script, never an LLM session** — an LLM
holding the gate token is a prompt-injection target that can be coaxed into
minting its own green status. Run it from `launchd` (or an equivalent local
scheduler), batching the queued PRs into one merge-train gate run per cycle
and bisecting to find the culprit only when that run is red (one PR at a
time, waiting in line, is the failure mode this avoids). The gate token lives
in the OS keychain, never a plain-text file; document a break-glass path
(the owner runs the same script by hand when the scheduled run can't).
`scripts/dcr-gates.sh` is the **one tracked entry point** both `ci.yml` and
the integrator call — no second, undocumented "run every gate locally"
script. The integrator refuses to push without a passing `dcr-gates.sh` run
against that exact head SHA, and **never** honors a `[skip ci]` commit
message on the ref main CI protects (a skip-ci merge into a protected branch
defeats the backstop main CI is there to be).

**Hosted CI that cannot actually block a merge is pure cost — verify branch protection before trusting it as a
gate.** A workflow running on every push is spend with zero enforcement value if nothing on the host actually
requires it to pass before a merge lands: no branch-protection rule naming it as a required check, so a red run
never stops anyone. One observed run: roughly 18,000 CI runs over about 25 days with no branch protection
configured; in one 24-hour window only about 25 of 1,000 queued jobs actually started before the account's CI
spend was refused, and disabling workflows one at a time still left two platform-injected default workflows
running. Query the host's actual branch-protection/required-checks state before trusting a green workflow as a
gate — a workflow *existing* and a workflow *enforced* are different claims (the Protocol / Host-enforced split
above). The first fix is to **make it a required check** — add the workflow to branch protection so a red run
actually blocks the merge; that alone converts spend into enforcement, no disabling needed. Only when the
workflow genuinely cannot be made to gate (no branch-protection hook available, or the owner declines) does
disabling apply, and even then **only the gating/test workflows** — leave release, deploy, and security-scan
workflows running unless the owner says otherwise, since those carry value beyond blocking a merge. Disable
**at the repo level, with owner authorization (below)**, not per-workflow — check for platform-injected default
workflows too, since a per-workflow disable can miss them — and replace the check with a **local QA receipt
bound to the merged PR's exact head SHA at merge time** (the `Verify:`-line discipline in
`verification-handback.md`, applied to the merge gate itself), never a hosted run nobody is
required to wait for. Disabling a repo-level workflow is a shared-state, hard-to-reverse change —
confirm with the owner before disabling, per the confirm-before-destructive-action rule.

**Removing hosted CI from an integration branch, and posting required
statuses under a separate identity, both need the repo owner's explicit
authorization and owner-held tokens** — an agent proposes this profile and
stops to ask; the host's own branch protection may otherwise read the
change as a CI bypass and block it regardless of what an agent decides
locally.

A commit **status needs a SHA that already exists on GitHub** — a purely
local merge has no such SHA, and a required check on a protected branch
evaluates the PR head, not an unpublished local merge. The gate first
refuses unless the working tree is exactly the committed HEAD (no unstaged,
staged, or untracked changes — a `--no-commit` staging area is not a
committed result), fetches the target branch fresh (never a stale cached
ref) and fails closed if no base is resolvable. So the flow is: push the
gated SHA (never a moving `HEAD`) to a scratch ref (`refs/integrator/tmp`,
force-pushed each cycle — it is disposable), run the gate against that
pushed SHA, post the status on it, and only then **fast-forward** the
protected branch to that same SHA (a plain, non-forced push — git itself
refuses a non-fast-forward, so a stale or diverged integrator run can never
silently overwrite history). Both pushes are performed AS the push identity
— authenticated via a credential helper, not read out of an env var and
merely compared by name — so "separate identity" is a property of the push
itself, not a second, self-asserted variable. If the branch's protection
needs a required status, it is posted by a **separate gate identity** from
the one that pushed — a status minted by the pusher's own token is forgeable
(any push-access credential can POST any commit status for any SHA) and
proves nothing about whether a gate ran; `templates/integrator-gate.sh`
refuses to post when the gate token's `gh api user` login equals the push
token's. Pre-push hooks (`pre-push-verify.sh`) are convenience, not
enforcement — they are self-report, bypassable by `--no-verify` or a
repointed hook.
**The local gate is not evidence unless it runs in the same OS/toolchain as
main CI** — GNU vs BSD coreutils, shell built-ins, and line-ending handling
differ enough that a macOS-only local pass proves nothing about a Linux-runner
result. `ubuntu-latest` is a VM image, not a published container, so "the
same image main CI uses" is only true once main CI itself declares a
`container:`. Pin **one multi-arch image by digest** and use it both as main
CI's `container:` and locally (`docker run`/`colima`/OrbStack — do not assume
Docker Desktop's organization licensing applies; verify it for the actual
operator). Apple Silicon runs an `arm64` pull of that digest natively while
`ubuntu-latest` is `amd64` — document that arch gap rather than hiding it;
main CI is what catches an arch-specific bug, the local run is not a
substitute for that coverage, only for the rest of the gate.

**Main/release:** hosted CI runs only on PRs into the default branch.
`pull_request` trigger `types: [opened, reopened, ready_for_review,
synchronize]` — omitting `opened`/`reopened` means a PR opened directly as
ready (never drafted) gets no initial run at all, only on its next push; a
job-level `if:` still skips a draft (drafts stay skipped — a draft's checks
would burn minutes on work not yet ready for review), which is the actual
gate, not the trigger's `types:` list. Workflow-level `concurrency` with
`cancel-in-progress: true` (safe
because a branch gets one final push per PR before merge); every job carries
`timeout-minutes`. No `push` trigger, no post-merge run, no `schedule:` by
default (weekly at most, for probes only — a daily-or-more-frequent cron
burns minutes with no PR for a reviewer to object to). A required check's
workflow is never `paths`/`paths-ignore`-filtered or workflow-level
conditional — an unmatched filter means the check never reports, so the PR
blocks forever "waiting for status"; scope with a job-level `if:` that still
reports success/skip instead. Consolidate jobs into fewer workflows —
GitHub rounds every job's minutes **up** to the next whole minute, so five
10-second jobs bill as five minutes. Linux runners unless a job genuinely
needs Windows/macOS (macOS bills at roughly 30x a Linux 1-core minute).

**Synthetic probes & uptime checks are monitoring, not CI** — never solve
their cost by cutting how often they run (that degrades detection time, the
thing they exist for). Move them to free infrastructure that isn't billed
runner-minutes: a local `cron`/`launchd` job, or a free tier of a dedicated
uptime monitor, at their **original** cadence. A local scheduler has no
dead-man switch of its own — a laptop that sleeps or a probe process that
dies goes silent with nobody noticing the watcher itself is gone. Using only
free tools: on a probe failure, `gh issue create` (GitHub's own free email
notification, zero Actions minutes — an optional `ntfy.sh` push is extra,
not required); every probe run, pass or fail, writes a heartbeat (a
timestamp file or an updated issue/gist). A GitHub Actions `schedule:` stays
at the doctrine's own cap (none, or weekly) and is used **only** to check
that heartbeat is fresh — failing loudly (a new issue, a red check) when it
has gone stale — never as the frequent prober itself.

**Self-hosted runners:** compute is free (no included-minute draw, no
per-minute charge, regardless of repo visibility) — but only inside a
disposable VM/container with no host secrets and restricted egress, ephemeral
or JIT (one job, then torn down). Never on the bare host for a job that
executes untrusted or agent-ingested content (a scraped doc, a dependency
README, a prompt-injected issue) — GitHub's own guidance that self-hosted
runners on private repos are compromised by "anyone who can fork the
repository and open a pull request" describes the fork-PR threat; an
agent-authored-code threat is broader (the agent itself can be coaxed into
emitting exfiltrating code) and needs isolation regardless of PR trust level.

**Merge queue:** only available on a public repo, or a private repo **owned
by an organization on GitHub Enterprise Cloud** — not Team, not Pro, not a
personal-account repo. Verify plan and ownership before relying on it; where
unavailable, a merge train (`merge_train.py`) is the mechanized substitute
(see `references/merge-queue-worktrees.md` — not restated here).

**Spend backstop:** a soft budget (alert-only, never a hard stop that could
block legitimate CI) — configure alerts at 50/80/100% of the cap so an
operator sees the trend before it bills out, not just at the limit.

**Tokens:** cheapest model tier that fits the task (`CLAUDE_CODE_SUBAGENT_MODEL`
above); per-lane tool-call caps; no reminder/poll loop firing more often than
every 20 minutes; never poll a merge (`gh pr merge --auto` schedules the
merge server-side instead of a loop re-checking status); `token_report.py
--budget` before a paid run, not after. **Cost cuts never apply to review
depth on a security-critical or gate/enforcement change** (anything that
grants merge/push rights, mints a credential, or changes what a gate checks)
— that review keeps the strongest available model plus an independent
reviewer; the cheapest-tier default is for mechanical lanes (formatting,
boilerplate, a routine dependency bump), not for judging whether a control
actually holds.

**A lane that hits its tool/token cap mid-task hands back a checkpoint, never
a "done" claim.** The handback states what ran, what did not, and marks the
result `UNVERIFIED` for whatever gate it could not complete — the caller
re-dispatches the remainder instead of trusting a claim the lane had no
budget left to earn. This is the same claim-honesty rule the top of this file
applies everywhere else: a check that could not run is `UNVERIFIED`, never a
pass.

**A rule moved out of a must-load file needs an eval proving its trigger
fires** — a routed `references/*.md` with zero evals citing it is unproven
prose, the same gap `docs/standards-index.md`'s routing rule closes for
"is it findable" but not for "does it work." `scripts/eval_citation_lint.py`
(repo root, `--selftest`-backed) flags exactly that: a references file this
skill's `SKILL.md` routes to, that no eval in the skill's `evals/evals.json`
cites by name. It is advisory today, run per-skill (`eval_citation_lint.py
<skill-dir> [--gate]`), not yet wired into the repo-wide gate — several
skills' reference files predate this check and are not yet retrofitted with
citing evals; that backlog is a deferred, named follow-up, not silently
closed. Both evals this section itself added
(`agentic-delivery/evals/evals.json`) cite `host-enforcement.md` by name, so
this file passes the check today.

## Deferred-question hooks (optional, advisory)

**Advisory, not Host-enforced:** they never block and never continue a turn.
`agentic-ceo/scripts/stop_reminder.py` — **use this when** an autonomous run
has stalled on a question the absent owner could not answer while other work
remained. A notice is due when a `task_ledger.py defer` question is pending and
an open or doing row exists. The hook event picks the output (hooks reference,
`docs/standards-index.md`, 2026-09-24):

- `SessionStart` / `UserPromptSubmit`: **model-visible** —
  `hookSpecificOutput.additionalContext` says "pending deferred questions: N;
  next non-gated item: T-###" at turn start.
- `Stop`: an **owner-facing** notice via `systemMessage` ("Warning message shown
  to the user"); the model is not guaranteed to see it.

Any failure (missing module, bad input, malformed file, crash) prints nothing
and exits 0. The snippet adds `|| true` and a short `timeout`, so even a missing
script cannot exit 2, which would block `Stop`. The owner can still stop the
agent or answer. `--selftest` proves each branch. The owner installs it by
hand; `install.sh` never edits settings:

```json
"hooks": {
  "UserPromptSubmit": [
    { "hooks": [{ "type": "command", "timeout": 5,
        "command": "python3 \"$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR\"/.claude/skills/agentic-ceo/scripts/stop_reminder.py || true" }] }
  ],
  "Stop": [
    { "hooks": [{ "type": "command", "timeout": 5,
        "command": "python3 \"$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR\"/.claude/skills/agentic-ceo/scripts/stop_reminder.py || true" }] }
  ]
}
```
