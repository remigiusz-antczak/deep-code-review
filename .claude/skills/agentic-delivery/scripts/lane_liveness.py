"""lane_liveness.py — report a background lane's liveness by positive evidence, never a kill verdict.

WHY THIS EXISTS (the failure it closes, #1070)
-----------------------------------------------
Under heavy multi-agent load, a commit can take minutes and a gate run longer
still: a lane that has produced nothing new in an hour is routinely SLOW, not
STUCK. An orchestrator that reads "elapsed time, no PR yet" as evidence of a
hang kills the lane, discovers near the end that it was almost done, and pays
for the stop, the resume, and the re-work — repeatedly, on the same false
inference. This script replaces that inference with a report built only from
POSITIVE, checkable signals, so "no PR yet" is never mistaken for "dead."

THE RULE
--------
Report exactly one of four states for a worktree `P`, each backed by the
evidence lines that produced it:

  ALIVE       a process is running for this lane (an explicit --pid that
              answers, or a process whose current working directory resolves
              inside `P`) AND that lane shows recent product activity: a file
              under `P` (excluding `.git`) modified within `--quiet-minutes`,
              the git index/refs modified within that window, or measured CPU
              time moving on the lane's process(es) across a short sample.

  QUIET       a live process with no recent product signal (long silent work:
              compiling, a slow test suite, a network wait), or recent product
              activity with no process currently found (a lane that just
              finished a step and is between processes). QUIET is a prompt to
              look closer, never a kill signal.

  UNVERIFIED  no process and no recent activity were found, BUT a detector
              was blind: the cwd-scan could not run or did not succeed (no
              `lsof` and no `/proc`, an lsof error or timeout, or a scan that
              could not see this script's own process), or the file walk hit
              an unreadable directory. Absence of evidence from a blind
              detector is not evidence of absence, so this is never DEAD.

  DEAD        the cwd-scan RAN AND SUCCEEDED and found no process with its cwd
              in `P` (and --pid, if given, does not answer) AND the file walk
              completed without error AND no product activity (file mtime, or
              git index/refs mtime) is younger than `--quiet-minutes`.

DEAD is the only state that can justify reaping a lane, and even then it is
evidence, not a mandate: killing a lane is a destructive, shared-state action
(`verification-handback.md`: closing or deleting shared state needs evidence,
not presumption), so the orchestrator confirms before it acts. This script
NEVER prints a kill recommendation — DEAD is a report, not an instruction.

EVIDENCE SOURCES
-----------------
1. Process alive: `--pid` answers `os.kill(pid, 0)` (exists, any state,
   including a zombie the OS hasn't reaped — a known limitation, noted below),
   OR a process whose cwd resolves inside `P` — found via `lsof -a -d cwd -F
   pn` when the `lsof` binary is available, else (Linux only) by reading
   `/proc/<pid>/cwd` for every numeric entry in `/proc`. A scan counts as
   SUCCEEDED only if it ran without error or timeout AND it saw this script's
   own process (a scan that cannot see its own caller cannot be trusted to
   have seen the lane's). Otherwise the scan is BLIND, which rules out DEAD.
2. Newest file mtime under `P`, walking the tree and excluding any `.git`
   directory (a lane's own git operations must not look like "no activity").
3. git index/refs mtime: resolves the real git-dir for `P` (`git rev-parse
   --git-dir`, so a linked worktree's per-worktree gitdir is used, not the
   common one) and takes the newest mtime among `HEAD`, `index`, `refs/`
   (recursively) and `packed-refs`, whichever exist. A `git` failure (not a
   repository, binary missing) just drops this signal; it does not error the
   whole run.
4. Child CPU time delta: for every pid found in (1), reads cumulative CPU
   time via `ps -o time= -p <pid>` twice, `--sample-seconds` apart (default
   0.5s), and reports whether it moved. Both `ps` TIME shapes parse: procps
   `[dd-]hh:mm:ss` and macOS `mm:ss.cc` (minutes unbounded). A pid that
   exits between samples, or that `ps` cannot see, contributes no delta
   (never misread as "moved").

LIMITATIONS (stated, not hidden)
---------------------------------
- A zombie process still answers `os.kill(pid, 0)`: this script does not
  distinguish "running" from "exited but unreaped" for an explicit --pid. The
  cwd-scan and CPU-delta checks are unaffected (a zombie has no cwd entry and
  no moving CPU time), so a zombie alone does not produce a false ALIVE.
- The cwd-scan needs `lsof` or `/proc` (Linux); on a host with neither, an
  explicit `--pid` is the only process evidence available, and a lane with no
  answering --pid and no recent activity reports UNVERIFIED, never DEAD.
- The own-process canary proves the scan can see this user's processes, not
  another user's; a lane running as a different user may be invisible.
- This tool answers "is this lane alive," never "is this lane's OUTPUT
  correct" — a live, busy process can still be building the wrong thing.

USAGE
-----
  lane_liveness.py --worktree PATH [--pid N] [--quiet-minutes M] [--sample-seconds S]
  lane_liveness.py --selftest

EXIT CODES
----------
  0  ALIVE
  1  QUIET
  2  error: a usage error (unknown flag, missing --worktree) or a --worktree
     that is not a directory — never a verdict
  3  UNVERIFIED
  4  DEAD (a caller may branch on it, but it is not authorization to kill;
     see THE RULE above)
`--help` exits 0 and prints no LANE_LIVENESS line; parse the verdict line,
not the exit code alone, when a flag could be malformed.
