"""focus_gate.py — no work outside the owner's open priority until that priority is done or blocked.

WHY THIS EXISTS (the failure it closes)
----------------------------------------
Agent fleets repeatedly stopped working on the owner's main priority before it
was finished and drifted to cheaper, more visible items. The prose rule ("an
open owner priority outranks every other item") existed and did not fire: every
drifting lane had a locally plausible reason to move on. This gate turns the
rule into a blocking fact. The owner writes the priority down once; the
priority is DONE only when its acceptance command exits 0, never when a lane
judges it "close enough".

THE RULE
--------
  status  NONE     no record at --rev and none ever existed in its (complete)
                   history, or an owner-trusted commit deleted it: nothing to
                   focus on. A shallow clone cannot prove "never existed" -> OPEN.
          OPEN     the record is trusted, its acceptance command did not exit 0,
                   and no valid blocker row exists — or the record is unreadable,
                   malformed, not owner-authored, or deleted by a non-owner (fail
                   closed: never DONE, and an untrusted scope puts nothing in scope).
          DONE     the acceptance command exited 0 in a clean detached worktree of
                   --rev (`git worktree add --detach`, removed afterwards), never
                   the working tree. Evidence: the sha actually tested, exit code,
                   duration, output tail. A DONE is cached under .git/, keyed by
                   record hash + tested sha, so an unchanged check does not re-run
                   the command (--no-cache disables it).
          BLOCKED  not DONE, and at least one blocker row names another party
                   AND an http(s) evidence link. A row without both is
                   reported as rejected and the priority stays OPEN.
  check   GO       the priority is NONE (with a notice), DONE, or BLOCKED, or
                   the item/paths are inside the priority scope.
          NO-GO    the priority is OPEN and the item/paths are outside scope.
  In scope means: (the item is a scope ref, or every changed path matches a
  scope glob) AND no changed path falls outside the globs — tagging a change
  with the priority's issue number does not carry unrelated paths in with it,
  and a refs-only record puts every changed path outside.
  Oracle guard: when the priority is DONE but the change touches a path named
  in the acceptance command that is outside scope (the reference design, the
  differ script), the DONE is unproven for that change and the verdict is
  NO-GO — land oracle changes separately, owner-reviewed. Without --head the
  guard also counts uncommitted working-tree edits.

RECORD GRAMMAR (default path `.claude/PRIORITY.md`; read from the committed
blob at `--rev`, never from the working tree, so an uncommitted edit is inert)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Only lines of the form `key: value` (optionally led by `- ` or `* `) with the
keys below are parsed; every other line (headings, prose) is ignored.
  priority: <id>                         exactly one; required
  scope: <token> [<token> ...]           repeatable; tokens split on space/comma.
                                         `#123` (any `#`-led token) is an item
                                         ref; anything else is a path glob
                                         (`**`, `*`, `?`; fix_class_gate grammar)
  acceptance: <shell command>            exactly one; one pair of surrounding
                                         backticks is stripped. Missing or
                                         duplicated -> OPEN, never DONE
  acceptance-trivial-ok: <reason>        owner line allowing a trivially-true
                                         acceptance (below)
  blocker: <party> | <evidence-url> | <note>
                                         repeatable; owner-accepted blocker
  owner-quote: <YYYY-MM-DD> | <where said> | <verbatim text>
                                         repeatable; the quote route (below)
Example:
  priority: design-alignment
  scope: app/screens/** #123 #124
  acceptance: python3 tools/parity_differ.py design.html app.html
  blocker: design vendor | https://example.com/tickets/42 | final spec pending

TRUST (same authorship rule as the standing grant in agentic-delivery SKILL.md)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Route 1, owner commit (the default and, without --allow-quote, the only route):
the last commit touching the record AND every commit that authored a surviving
line (`git blame`) must have an author email in the owner set, carry no
`Co-authored-by:` trailer (an agent-assisted commit is not the owner's own),
and, with --require-signed, a good signature (`%G?` = G). Route 2, owner quote
(only with --allow-quote): a quote row counts only when its own line is blamed
to such an owner commit — a record cannot vouch for itself — and then every
scope token and every valid blocker's party and evidence must appear as whole
tokens in those quotes, and the acceptance command as an exact backtick-quoted
span (`...`); a substring never matches. Owner set, first non-empty of:
--owner-email (repeatable), env DCR_OWNER_EMAIL (comma/space separated; in CI
set it from protected configuration), `git config --get-all dcr.owner` (a local
fallback that warns "unprotected owner identity": any process with write access
to the repository or home directory can edit it). None -> untrusted -> OPEN.
The acceptance command of an untrusted record is NEVER executed.
Rejected even in a trusted record: a scope glob made only of `*`, `/`, `?`
(`**`, `*`, `**/*`: too broad -> the record is untrusted), and a trivially-true
acceptance (`true`, `:`, `exit 0`, `ls`, `echo ...`, `... || true`, a pipe into
`cat`) -> OPEN, never DONE, unless an owner-authored `acceptance-trivial-ok:`
line is present.

WHAT IS ENFORCED, AND THE RESIDUAL
----------------------------------
Enforced: a record line, last touch, or deletion by an identity outside the
owner set, or by an owner commit carrying a Co-authored-by trailer, makes the
record untrusted (OPEN, nothing in scope) or the deletion NO-GO — so a lane
committing under its own identity or attribution convention cannot create,
widen, narrow, close, or delete the priority. Residual: an agent that holds the
owner's git identity AND commit access can forge all of it, because a commit
author email is unauthenticated metadata; --require-signed with a signing key
the agent cannot use is the only hard guarantee.

HONESTY (what this cannot prove)
--------------------------------
The owner-email setting is the trust root: in CI set DCR_OWNER_EMAIL from
protected configuration, not from a file the change under review can edit. The
quote route cannot authenticate a quote beyond its line's blame. The trivial
list is a heuristic denylist, not a proof that a command tests anything. The
DONE cache is a file any local process can write; CI starts from a fresh clone,
and --no-cache removes the cache from the trust path. The oracle guard covers
paths named literally in the acceptance command, not their transitive imports.
DONE proves the owner's own acceptance command passed on the tested sha; it
cannot judge whether that command is the right test.
