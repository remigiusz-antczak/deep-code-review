"""merge_train.py — land several green PRs as ONE verified union (a merge train).

WHY THIS EXISTS (the failure it closes)
----------------------------------------
deep-code-review's `references/merge-operations.md` (*Merge trains*) states
the rules for landing several independently-green PRs without a platform
merge queue: verify the combination once, isolate a culprit by holding the
others out for the suspect's whole verification cycle (issue #1119), attribute
a numeric-cap overshoot to the member that owns it (issue #1106), retry the
union immediately after parking a member instead of sleeping a cycle per
conflict (issue #1134), and never merge onto a base that moved or was
rewritten after the union was proved (issue #1137), and never compare against
a stale fetched ref (issue #1139). Prose alone let every one
of those rules be skipped under pressure; this script is the mechanism.

SUBCOMMANDS
-----------
  plan    List open PRs targeting --base that are non-draft, same-repo (fork
          heads skipped unless --allow-forks), MERGEABLE, not parked, and
          green: the LATEST check run per name is completed with conclusion
          success/neutral/skipped, and at least --min-checks (K, >= 1) of those
          latest runs are `success`. Commit statuses (the legacy status API)
          are not read. Read-only.
  verify  Re-plan, fetch the base and every member head (`git ls-remote`
          first, then forced refspecs into refs unique to this run; a failed
          fetch or a base still stale after bounded retries stops the cycle,
          while a member still stale, gone, or moved since plan is skipped
          alone), then build ONE union
          in a throwaway worktree (members merged in PR-number order onto the
          fresh base) and run --verify-cmd once in it (plus --count-cmd vs --cap
          when given). On a merge conflict the member is parked with its files
          and the union is rebuilt at once, so N conflicts cost one run, not N
          cycles (#1134). On a deterministic failure:
            - numeric cap failed (--count-cmd output > --cap): print one line
              per member, `#N +D marker=present|none`, where D is the count at
              the member's head minus the count at its own merge-base with the
              base, and marker is whether the member's own commit range carries
              a `<--marker-key>: ...` line (#1106); every member with D > 0 and
              marker=none is parked;
            - otherwise (or when attribution names no one): prefix bisection.
              The base alone must pass (else HALT); the smallest failing prefix
              names the culprit — the member whose inclusion breaks the gate.
              Members outside a prefix are held out for that prefix's entire
              verification run, never re-admitted mid-search (#1119).
          A parked member stays excluded from every later plan/verify until its
          head changes. The surviving union is rebuilt immediately. When a
          union is green the base SHA and member heads are recorded in --state.
  merge   Dry-run by default: prints what would merge. With --apply (and
          --grant) it merges the recorded members back-to-back with
          `gh pr merge --merge --match-head-commit`, preserving each member's
          own commits and closing keywords (never a squash of the union). It
          refuses (HALT) unless the base head equals the SHA the union was
          proved on: a fast-forward move means re-plan; a non-fast-forward move
          means a possible history rewrite and needs a human (#1137). It never
          re-verifies on its own. Before each merge the PR must still be OPEN,
          at the recorded head, and MERGEABLE (UNKNOWN is polled with bounded
          backoff); after each merge the new base head must be exactly the merge
          of the previous head and that member, else another writer moved the
          base mid-train (HALT). A member that fails deterministically is parked
          with its reason and the rest HALT, because the remaining combination
          was never verified.
  keystone  The owner's pre-ratified red-base exception for ONE fix PR (issue
          #1142; deep-code-review `merge-operations.md` *Red base*). Needs
          --only globs naming the files the fix may touch; every glob must
          start with a literal directory (`src/clock*.py`, never `*.py`, `s*`
          or `**`), and `*`/`?` never cross `/` (fix_class_gate's grammar).
          Refuses (HALT) unless, in order: the PR is open, targets --base, and
          passes plan's eligibility (non-draft, same-repo, MERGEABLE, checks
          green); every changed file (`git diff --name-only --no-renames`, so a
          file renamed in from elsewhere shows its source) matches --only; the
          grants file (fixed path `.claude/KEYSTONE-GRANTS`, never chosen by the
          caller), committed on the fetched base, holds a grant line blamed to
          an owner email with no Co-authored-by trailer (focus_gate's
          standing-grant check; owners from --owner-email, DCR_OWNER_EMAIL, or
          git config dcr.owner, none = HALT; --require-signed also needs a good
          signature). Grant lines:
            keystone: #<pr> @<sha>                                 pins the PR's head
            keystone: #<pr> | <globs> | expires=D | max-files=N    the PR, within limits
            keystone-class: <globs> | expires=D | max-files=N      one keystone of a shape
          A bare `keystone: #<pr>` is refused. Limits need an unexpired date at
          most 30 days after the line's commit, globs covering every changed
          file, and at most N files. The PR's own lines are tried before
          classes, and the first grant that passes wins, so a spent or
          non-covering class never blocks a usable one. Then --verify-cmd must
          FAIL on the base alone after every retry (a red no open branch
          introduced; a flake is not a red base) and PASS on base + PR in a
          throwaway union. It records the keystone in --state and parks every
          sibling carrying a copy: a shared `git patch-id --stable`
          (cherry-pick), the keystone diff reverse-applying to the sibling's
          tree (squash or amend), or another edit to a keystone file (possible
          partial copy). `verify` re-screens members on every run (a re-push
          cannot slip a copy in) until the keystone lands: its head is an
          ancestor of the base, its PR is MERGED, or the base contains its
          change. Dry-run by default, and a dry run spends nothing. --apply
          merges the keystone alone (same same-base, still-ready, and
          another-writer checks as `merge`) with `Keystone-Grant:
          <commit>:<line-key>` in the merge commit body. That trailer spends
          the grant: one already in the base's history is refused until the
          owner commits the line again. Grant reads run with
          --no-replace-objects and an empty blame.ignoreRevsFile.
          After an --apply merge it runs `refresh --apply` for the siblings,
          isolated: the merge already landed, so a refresh error is a WARN
          (exit still OK), never an ERROR/HALT that would make a landed
          merge look failed.
  refresh After a fix lands on the base, a CI re-run on an open PR reuses its
          OLD merge commit, so every PR opened before the fix stays red until
          its branch is updated: re-running is not the fix. Lists open PRs whose
          head lacks --since (default: the base head) and prints the exact
          `gh pr update-branch <n>` for each; --apply runs them. Always a merge
          commit, never `--rebase` (a rebase rewrites a branch its lane may be
          pushing to). A draft or a fork PR is skipped (--include-drafts /
          --allow-forks admit them). A PR carrying a copy of a keystone is
          skipped: it must drop the copy and rebase, not merge the fix in twice
          (the keystone screen parks it, and a PR parked for a keystone is
          never updated). Calls are throttled (--backoff between each) and a
          429/secondary-rate-limit response is retried on the existing
          --retries/--backoff schedule; a failed update is reported and the
          rest still run. Does not coordinate with a lane mid-push: run it
          only when no lane is pushing to the PRs it updates, or have lanes
          rebase afterward, since a lane's later force-push drops the merge
          commit refresh just made.
  dupes   Parallel lanes that each carry their own copy of one fix conflict
          with each other and the train parks all but one. Flags every set of
          >= 2 open PRs whose `git diff -U0` hunks in the same file overlap
          (within DUP_PAD lines) on their POST-image (the `+` lines; the
          pre-image is compared instead only for a pure deletion, which has
          no `+` lines) — two different fixes to the same line have the same
          pre-image but a different post-image, so they no longer group as
          one. An identical (whitespace-normalized) post-image is DUP-FIX
          (RED), names the lowest PR number canonical, and prints "one fix,
          one PR: <others> drop their copy and rebase on #<canonical>"; a
          near-identical one (difflib ratio >= --similarity, default 0.9, but
          not identical) is SIMILAR-FIX, printed for human review and never
          grouped or RED. Read-only.

FLAKY VS DETERMINISTIC
----------------------
A failing --verify-cmd is re-run up to --retries times on the same tree with
exponential backoff (--backoff seconds, doubling, capped at 300 s). A re-run
that passes is reported `FLAKY` and counts as a pass; failing every attempt is
deterministic. A failed `gh pr merge` is retried on the same bounded schedule.
Parking a member never sleeps.

AUTHORITY AND SAFETY
--------------------
Merging needs the integration owner or a standing grant the owner recorded.
For `merge`, `--apply` requires `--grant <ref>` naming that decision (a link
or record id); this script only checks that it is present and echoes it on
every MERGED line, so it cannot verify that grant. `keystone` checks its
grant's git authorship, which is only as strong as commit metadata: without
signing (--require-signed, with a key the agent cannot use), an author identity
is spoofable by anyone who can write commits locally. Branch protection on the
grants file (owner-only review or push) is the real control; this check
catches mistakes and agent-written grants, not a determined forger. The
script never pushes: any `git push` it is asked to run raises HALT, so it cannot force-push a shared branch. --verify-cmd
runs PR code on this machine, which is why fork PRs are skipped by default.

OUTPUT AND EXIT CODES
---------------------
One line per action (ELIGIBLE, SKIP, PLAN, FAIL, FLAKY, PARK, GREEN, RED,
KEYSTONE, WOULD-MERGE, MERGED, WOULD-UPDATE, UPDATED, UPDATE-FAILED, DUP-FIX,
SIMILAR-FIX, WARN, NOOP, HALT, ERROR, DROP-FAILED). Untrusted text (check
names, file names, forge errors) is stripped of control characters and
truncated.
  0  plan listed; union green; dry-run printed; members merged; nothing to do;
     a keystone landed even if its post-merge refresh then WARNs
  1  verify found no green union (every member parked); refresh had an update
     fail; dupes found a duplicated fix (a SIMILAR-FIX alone does not)
  2  usage or forge/git error (fail closed; nothing is guessed)
  3  HALT: base moved or rewritten, base red, another writer mid-train, a
     member failed at merge time, a member landed but the new base could
     not be verified, a refused push, or a keystone condition that does
     not hold
