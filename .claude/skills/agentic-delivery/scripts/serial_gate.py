"""serial_gate.py — fail-closed test selection + a cross-lane serial run lock.

WHY THIS EXISTS (the failure it closes)
----------------------------------------
N parallel agent lanes share one repo. If each lane runs the FULL test suite
on every push, the lanes self-DoS the host (CPU/RAM contention, flaky timeouts
that look like real failures). The fix — path-scoped test selection ("only
run the tests near what changed") — introduces a worse failure if it is
wrong: a bad glob silently SKIPS the tests that would have caught a
regression, and the change ships untested with a green check mark. So the
selector itself must be fail-closed (any input it cannot classify with
confidence runs the FULL suite, never "nothing to run, pass") and it must be
testable (`--selftest` pins every fail-closed branch with a real assertion).

Serializing the shared-state parts of a multi-lane push (a migration, a
generated file, the integration branch) needs a real cross-process lock. This
uses `fcntl.flock(fd, LOCK_EX | LOCK_NB)` on a lock file — a KERNEL advisory
lock, not a hand-rolled one: the `flock(2)` syscall exists on both macOS and
Linux (the common "macOS has no flock" claim is about the `flock(1)` CLI
binary used to wrap a shell command, which macOS indeed lacks — the Python
`fcntl.flock()` syscall binding is unaffected and has always worked on both).
A kernel lock has one property no user-space "stale lock" scheme can fully
replicate: the kernel releases it the instant the holding process's last file
descriptor closes, for ANY reason the process ends — clean exit, uncaught
exception, or `SIGKILL`. There is nothing to reclaim and nothing to age out.

TWO SUBCOMMANDS
----------------
select --map <map.tsv> [--base REF --head REF | --changed-file PATH ...]
    Print selected test targets, one per line, OR the single line `FULL`
    meaning "run the whole suite." Exit 0 on a resolved selection (mapped
    or FULL). Exit 2 — plus a reason on stderr — when the input itself could
    not be resolved (a bad ref, a malformed or missing map): FULL is still
    printed to stdout (a caller that only checks stdout still runs the full
    suite), but the caller's script SHOULD treat exit 2 as "investigate,"
    not silently continue.

    MAP FILE FORMAT (tab-separated; one row per line):
      <glob>\t<test target>       — changed path matching <glob> selects <test target>
      !full\t<glob>                — changed path matching <glob> forces FULL
      # comment or blank line      — ignored
    The map file's OWN path is always FULL-forcing, whether or not it also
    appears as a `!full` row — a change to the routing table itself is by
    definition a change no fixed row can vouch for. "Own path" is compared
    both as given and relative to the repository top level (`git rev-parse
    --show-toplevel`, run in --repo or the cwd), so an absolute or
    cwd-relative --map still matches the repo-relative path git reports.

    The diff is read with `git diff --name-only --no-renames`: a rename is
    reported as its deleted OLD path plus its added NEW path, so moving a
    file out of a `!full` or mapped area can never hide the old path.

    GLOB SEMANTICS (exactly what is implemented, not "glob-like"): each
    changed path is normalized to a repo-root-relative POSIX path (backslashes
    turned to `/`, no leading `./`), then matched against each pattern with
    `fnmatch.fnmatchcase`. `fnmatch` has no path-separator concept: a bare
    `*` already matches across `/` the same way `**` conventionally does, `?`
    matches exactly one character, and `[seq]`/`[!seq]` match a character
    class — literally, per Python's `fnmatch` module. `**` is accepted and
    behaves identically to a single `*` (both translate through the same
    "match anything" rule); there is no directory-scoped single-`*`.

    FAIL-CLOSED RULES, in order:
      (a) map missing / unreadable / malformed (bad row shape)   -> FULL, exit 2
      (b) unresolvable ref / git error resolving the diff        -> FULL, exit 2
      (c) empty diff (nothing changed)                           -> FULL, exit 0
      (d) any changed path matches NO row                        -> FULL, exit 0
      (e) any changed path matches a `!full` glob, or IS the map -> FULL, exit 0
      (f) otherwise: union of every matched row's target(s), deduped, sorted

run --lock-dir DIR [--timeout SECONDS] [--slots N] [--retry K --backoff S --retry-on REGEX] -- <cmd...>
    Serialize <cmd...> across lanes with a kernel advisory lock:
    `fcntl.flock(fd, LOCK_EX | LOCK_NB)` on the file `DIR/lock` (DIR is
    created if missing). A waiter polls with bounded exponential backoff
    (capped, jittered) until it acquires the lock or --timeout elapses
    (default 120s) — on timeout, exits 124 and NEVER runs <cmd...> unlocked.
    Once acquired, the SAME fd is truncated and rewritten with an
    informational owner record (pid, host, UTC acquire time) for a human
    inspecting the lock file; this record is never read back by the tool and
    never consulted for correctness — only the flock decides who holds the
    lock. The lock is released (and the fd closed) in `finally` and on
    SIGTERM/SIGINT; the OS additionally guarantees release on any other
    process death, including SIGKILL, because a dead process cannot hold an
    open file descriptor. The child's own exit code is propagated. There is
    no staleness window, no age-based reclaim, and no lock file to "clean up
    by hand": a lock that looks held IS held, for as long as its holder's
    process is alive, however long that is — NO STALE-LOCK TAKEOVER, here or
    at any slot below: nothing ages out, nothing is adopted from a plain
    `run` (only `--singleton`, above, ever adopts, and only its own kind).

    --slots N: an N-slot semaphore instead of one lock — N independent flock
    files (`DIR/lock.0` .. `DIR/lock.N-1`; N=1, the default, is exactly the
    single `DIR/lock` file above, unchanged). A caller takes whichever slot
    is free first, so up to N callers run at once and caller N+1 queues with
    the same bounded, jittered backoff and --timeout/124 semantics as a
    single lock (#1127: cap the heavy tier at N concurrent instead of
    serializing it to 1 or leaving it uncapped). Each slot is released the
    same way a single lock is — its holder exiting, including SIGKILL — so
    there is nothing to age out per slot either.

    --retry K --backoff S --retry-on REGEX: retry the WHOLE acquire+run+
    release cycle up to K more times (bounded: at most K+1 attempts, ever)
    when an attempt exits nonzero AND its captured stdout+stderr matches
    REGEX — never on a plain nonzero exit that doesn't match, so a lane's
    real test/lint failure is reported at once instead of retried into a
    fresh resource-exhaustion storm (#1127's failure mode: N lanes each
    retrying a transient error amplify the very shortage that caused it).
    Each retry waits an exponentially growing, jittered backoff (`S * 2^n`,
    capped) before the next attempt. `--retry-on` is required whenever
    `--retry` > 0 — an unconditional retry-on-any-failure is refused
    (exit 2), since that is exactly the amplifying loop this closes.

run --singleton --lock-dir DIR [--build-id ID] -- <helper cmd...>
    Make a long-lived helper (a watchdog, a static server) a singleton across
    sessions, so "start the helper" is idempotent however many sessions call
    it (#1078). One non-blocking try of the same flock: if it is free, fork
    a small SUPERVISOR process that keeps the only lock fd and starts the
    helper WITHOUT it (the fd is close-on-exec and never passed), then
    propagate the helper's exit code. So the lock lives exactly as long as
    the helper: it survives SIGKILL of this wrapper (the supervisor lives on),
    and it is released the moment the helper exits even if the helper left a
    backgrounded grandchild behind (a grandchild that inherited the fd would
    otherwise hold the lock with no recorded process alive). Accepted gap:
    SIGKILL of the supervisor itself releases the lock while the helper may
    still run; nothing portable can tie a lock to an arbitrary program's
    lifetime without handing that program the fd.
    If it is held, never wait and never start a twin: read the holder's
    record, then exit 0 with `adopted`, or refuse with exit 75
    (NOT_ADOPTED, EX_TEMPFAIL from sysexits.h) and one marker line on stdout:
      `SERIAL_GATE: STALE_HOLDER`  --build-id is given and the live holder's
                                   recorded build id differs (it can still be
                                   serving stale code);
      `SERIAL_GATE: ORPHAN_HOLDER` the lock is held but the record names no
                                   live process: its `pid` is dead, or alive
                                   with a different start time than recorded
                                   (pid reuse), or the record is unreadable or
                                   has no start time. Some process outside
                                   the record holds the lock ("orphan holds
                                   lock"); it is never adopted.
    The marker, not the number alone, identifies a refusal: a helper may
    itself exit 75. A holder is reported, never killed: stop it only if it is
    yours. --timeout is ignored. No pidfile check-then-write (a race) and no
    `pgrep -f <name>` match (it can match the caller's own shell and exit
    with zero instances running): only the kernel lock decides who holds it;
    the record's pid plus start time decide only whether to trust the record.

    PLATFORM SCOPE: POSIX advisory locks (`flock`) apply per open-file-table
    entry on a single host's local filesystem. This is not a distributed
    lock: it does not work over NFS or other network filesystems, and it says
    nothing about processes on a different host. Use it only for lanes on one
    shared host talking to one shared local disk. `fcntl` does not exist on
    Windows; `run` on a platform without it fails closed (exit 2, <cmd...>
    never runs) rather than silently running unlocked.
