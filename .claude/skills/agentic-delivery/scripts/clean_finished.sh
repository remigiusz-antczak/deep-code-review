# clean_finished.sh — remove your own finished worktrees and scratch. Safe to run on every tick.
# A worktree under ROOT is finished when its branch's PR is MERGED or CLOSED (gh pr view), or its branch is
# listed in HANDED_BACK (optional file, one branch per line: lanes that handed back). It is removed unless:
#   - a process has it open (lsof +D), or
#   - it has unpushed commits (commits not on any remote; a MERGED PR whose head is exactly HEAD counts as
#     pushed, since squash-and-delete-branch leaves no remote ref).
# A dirty worktree is archived first: `git diff HEAD` plus the untracked-file list go to
# ARCHIVE_DIR/<name>.patch, or <name>.N.patch when that exists (default $TMPDIR/worktree-archive), and it is removed only after the write succeeded.
# The main worktree and the one you run from are never removed. Untracked file CONTENTS are listed, not saved.
# Detached-HEAD worktrees have no branch to judge and are left alone.
# SCRATCH (optional, space-separated absolute paths): deleted outright (never "/" or $HOME).
# Env: ROOT (required, absolute dir: only worktrees under it are touched), GH (default gh).
# Prints "removed=N skipped=M archived=K".
