"""Lane-start isolation guard: refuse unless this lane really is isolated.

Run as the FIRST step of every write-lane, from the lane's working directory:

    python3 .claude/skills/agentic-delivery/scripts/lane_guard.py --expect-branch NAME

Exit 0 (one `LANE_GUARD OK:` line) only when ALL hold:
  1. --expect-branch was given. Without it the guard could only prove "some
     linked worktree on some non-default branch", not "this lane's worktree",
     so it refuses. --allow-any-branch waives this for a non-lane probe and
     then makes only that weaker claim; a lane brief never uses it.
  2. git answers a plain read in the cwd (a PATH shim or sandbox that blocks
     git fails it). A tool-call hook never sees this subprocess, so chain the
     lane's own direct read first: `git rev-parse HEAD && python3 lane_guard.py`.
  3. The cwd is a LINKED worktree: `git rev-parse --git-dir` differs from
     `--git-common-dir`. Equal means the main checkout (a shared tree), which
     is exactly the escape this guard exists to catch.
  4. HEAD is on a named branch (not detached) that is not a default branch.
  5. HEAD's branch equals --expect-branch exactly.
  6. No OTHER live process — excluding this process and its own ancestor
     chain (the calling shell/orchestrator, which can itself have its cwd
     inside the worktree) — has its cwd inside the worktree. Reuses
     `lane_liveness.py`'s cwd-occupancy scan by import
     (`lane_liveness.foreign_cwd_pids`), never a second implementation. When
     that scan itself is blind (no lsof, no /proc, or a scan that can't see
     its own process), this refuses as UNVERIFIED — a blind scan is never
     read as "no foreign process" — unless --allow-unverified is passed
     (owner-only escape hatch, documented here, never a default: it trades a
     confirmed absence of a live writer for an explicit human call).

Otherwise exit 1 with exactly one `LANE_GUARD REFUSE: <reason>` line on stdout,
written to be quoted verbatim in the lane's handback. The lane stops at that
point; it never retries the refused step through another path.

DEFAULT BRANCHES. A union, never a single guess: `main` and `master`, the
remote HEAD's target (`git symbolic-ref refs/remotes/origin/HEAD`) when set,
the main checkout's current branch (first entry of `git worktree list
--porcelain`) when it is on one, and --default-branch when given (it adds to
the set, never replaces it). A stale origin/HEAD therefore cannot make `main`
pass. Fails closed: when the worktree list cannot be read, or when neither
origin/HEAD, the main checkout's branch, nor --default-branch names a branch
(so the repository's real default is unknown), the guard refuses.

ENVIRONMENT. GIT_DIR, GIT_WORK_TREE, GIT_COMMON_DIR and GIT_INDEX_FILE are
removed from every git call's environment, so an inherited variable (for
example from a git hook) cannot point the check at a different repository than
the cwd. Read-only: the guard never writes to the repository.

    lane_guard.py --selftest    builds throwaway repos and proves every
                                refusal fires (and that the OK case passes).

HANDBACK MODE. Run as the LAST step before the orchestrator relays a lane's PR
onward (merges it, or hands it to a human/reviewer), from a checkout that can
resolve both refs:

    python3 .claude/skills/agentic-delivery/scripts/lane_guard.py handback \
        --sha <lane-head-sha> --base <dispatch-base> --branch <lane-branch> \
        [--cite <path> ...] [--artifact-root <dir>]

<dispatch-base> is the integration ref the lane was dispatched from (and
will land on).

Catches a root/orphan commit: a lane that committed in an unusual state (an
orphan or unborn HEAD, or plumbing commands) can produce a head whose tree is
the whole repository, yet a tree-diff PR view and CI both look normal — the
defect surfaces only on rebase, as a full-tree conflict. Exit 0 (one
`LANE_GUARD OK:` line) only when ALL hold:
  0. `git rev-parse --is-shallow-repository` is not `true` (a shallow clone's
     truncated history cannot prove ancestry either way, so this refuses
     before attempting any of the diagnosis below), and neither a graft
     (`$(git rev-parse --git-common-dir)/info/grafts` does not exist) nor a
     replace ref can rewrite parentage — every git call in this mode runs
     with `GIT_NO_REPLACE_OBJECTS=1`.
  1. `git log -1 --format=%P <sha>` succeeds and is non-empty (the head has at
     least one parent — a root/orphan commit's is empty).
  2. `git merge-base <sha> <base>` succeeds (the head shares history with the
     integration ref; an unresolvable ref or an unrelated history both fail
     this).
  3. `git rev-list --max-parents=0 <base>..<sha>` succeeds and is empty (no
     root commit is reachable at all in `<base>..<head>` — catches an
     unrelated-history merge that pulls in a second root even though the
     merge commit itself has parents and a merge-base with `<base>`).
  4. `git rev-list --count <base>..<sha>` is non-zero: a head already reachable
     from the base the lane was dispatched from parked nothing (a lane that
     reports "parked <head>" while HEAD never moved).
  5. --sha is a 7-40 character lowercase hex id and the resolved commit
     starts with it (a ref name would always match its own tip), and the tip
     of --branch (`refs/heads/<branch>`, or a full `refs/...` name) is
     exactly that commit, so a sha from another branch, or a tip that moved
     after the claim, is refused.
  6. Every relative --cite is a file committed at the cited sha (`git
     cat-file -t <sha>:<path>` is `blob`, repo-root relative; empty and `..`
     paths refused; a file only on disk does not count). An absolute --cite
     (an artifact such as a composite image) counts only when it is an
     existing file inside the explicit --artifact-root.
Otherwise exit 1 with exactly one `LANE_GUARD REFUSE:` line. Fails closed:
any nonzero = refuse; pass only when exit 0 AND an OK line is printed — a
git failure at any step is a refusal, never a pass. Recovery: check out a
fresh branch from `<base>`, take the lane's files from the bad commit
(`git checkout <bad-sha> -- <paths>`), commit normally, and force-push with an
explicit lease on the old head (force-push stays owner/standing-grant gated,
same as any other force-push in this repo).

WAIT MODE. A lane that ends its turn with background work still running (a
browser test, a dev server, a build) hands back "waiting on background work"
instead of a verified result. Before the handback, wait for that work,
bounded, then verify:

    python3 .claude/skills/agentic-delivery/scripts/lane_guard.py wait \
        [--pid N ...] [--port N ...] [--file PATH ...] [--timeout S] \
        && python3 .claude/skills/agentic-delivery/scripts/lane_guard.py handback ...

Exit 0 (one `LANE_GUARD OK:` line) once every target is finished:
  - --pid: must already be running when the wait *starts* (a stale or
    mistyped pid is never silently "finished" — see below); once confirmed
    alive, finished means it no longer runs (gone, or a zombie nobody reaped
    yet — per `ps -o stat=`, falling back to a signal-0 probe).
  - --port: must be observed accepting a connection on `localhost:<port>` at
    least once within the `--settle` window (default 30s, capped at
    --timeout — a target that only ever starts up slowly is a REFUSE-worthy
    brief, not a longer wait); once confirmed listening, finished means
    nothing accepts a connection there any more. A port that never once
    listens is exactly as unverifiable as a pid that was never alive — never
    read as "already done".
  - --file: exists, is non-empty, and keeps the same size on two consecutive
    polls. No alive-at-start check (a file plausibly pre-exists from a prior
    run and is still the right target); point --file at a result written
    once at the end (a JUnit report, a status file), not a streaming log
    whose pauses look finished — for a log, wait on the writer's --pid.

Exit 2 with one `LANE_GUARD COULD_NOT_CHECK:` line naming the target when: a
--pid is not observed running at wait start; a --port is never observed
listening within the settle window; or --timeout seconds (default 300) pass
with something still running. A timeout is never a pass, and the handback
does not run. Exit 1 (`LANE_GUARD REFUSE:`) on no target, a pid below 1, a
port outside 1-65535, or a non-positive --timeout/--settle. Read-only: it
signals nothing and kills nothing.
