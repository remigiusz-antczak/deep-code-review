"""Verify a "done / fixed / deployed" claim on the AUTHORITATIVE surface.

A merged PR, a green CI run, or a local tree is a PROXY for delivery; the
surface a reviewer actually opens can be silently stale (a broken auto-sync
leaves a preview hours behind HEAD), and a local `main` can be thousands of
commits behind the real base. This script checks the claim where it counts.

WHAT IT PROVES — AND WHAT IT DOES NOT. A PASS proves that the surface serves
(or the remote branch contains) the claimed build. It does NOT prove the
feature works, renders, or is correct: pair it with the functional check.

Modes (stdlib only, no third-party dependency):

  served --url U --expect-sha S --probe SPEC [--probe SPEC ...]
      Fetch the running app and extract the build/commit id the SERVING
      PROCESS reports. SPEC is one of:
        header:NAME              a response header of U (case-insensitive)
        meta:NAME                <meta name|property="NAME" content="..."> in U
        path:/version.json:key   JSON at that same-origin path; key is dotted
                                 (e.g. build.sha)
      PASS only when at least one probe yields an id and every yielded id
      matches S (the shorter of the two, at least 7 hex chars, is a prefix of
      the longer). A value that is not a commit sha — a data timestamp, a
      semver, a JSON number — is NOT a build id: a payload's "data as of"
      stamp dates the artifact, not the running code. Redirects are NOT
      followed (a redirect means U is not the surface that serves the build;
      re-run with the Location URL if that is the real surface). --timeout
      bounds each socket read and, as a wall-clock cap, the body read.

  ref --repo DIR --branch B --expect-sha S [--remote origin] [--timeout 120]
      Fetch B from the remote the reviewer uses, then PASS only when S is an
      ancestor of (reachable from) that fetched remote head. A local branch or
      a stale local tree is never consulted. Fetch writes the remote-tracking
      ref refs/remotes/<remote>/<B>, exactly as a plain `git fetch` would.
      Git runs with GIT_TERMINAL_PROMPT=0 and no terminal; a call past
      --timeout seconds is killed and reported as COULD_NOT_CHECK.
      --require-clean also FAILs when --repo has any tracked change (staged
      or not) or any untracked, non-ignored file that is not committed
      (`git status --untracked-files=normal`): a commit a hook rejected
      leaves the edit staged, and a new file never added is left behind,
      while the already-pushed HEAD still passes — edit done is not
      committed, and committed is not pushed. Pass HEAD's sha with it.

  checks --gh-repo OWNER/NAME --sha S [--require NAME ...] [--timeout 60]
      Read the forge's check-runs for S (`gh api`, filter=latest, every
      page) and judge each check NAME by its own latest run — never a
      combined status rollup, which can carry stale or empty entries and
      undercount a green head. Runs are grouped by producer (app id, check
      suite id) and name. Per group: any run not completed is PENDING (a live
      rerun supersedes an older result); otherwise the run with the latest
      completion time decides: success / neutral / skipped is PASS,
      cancelled is PENDING (transient, never red), anything else is FAIL.
      When several producers emit one name (two workflows or apps both
      reporting `test`) and their latest verdicts disagree, the name is FAIL
      as ambiguous: a newer green from one producer never hides another's
      red. Re-run the failed producer's own run to resolve it.
      With --require, only those names count and a missing one is NO-RUN.
      Exit 1 on any FAIL; exit 2 on any PENDING / NO-RUN, no runs at all,
      a page count short of total_count, or a `gh` error; else PASS. Legacy
      commit statuses are not read: a check that reports only as a status
      shows as NO-RUN under --require (fail closed).

      --wait [--interval S] [--min-checks K]
          Poll the same per-name verdicts every S seconds (default 45) until
          every observed/required name is a terminal PASS, one is a terminal
          FAIL, or --timeout's total budget elapses (default 60s; in --wait
          mode --timeout is the WHOLE poll's wall-clock budget, not one gh
          call's — each individual gh read stays bounded to <=30s so a stuck
          call cannot itself eat the budget). --min-checks K (default 1)
          guards a false-green report: fewer than K names observed keeps
          polling rather than declaring ALL GREEN on zero dispatched checks.
          Prints exactly ONE line: `<gh-repo> @<sha> checks=<n> ALL GREEN` or
          `<gh-repo> @<sha> checks=<n> NOT-GREEN: <name, name, ...>`. Exit 0
          ALL GREEN; 1 a FAIL is terminal; 2 timed out still PENDING/NO-RUN or
          under --min-checks, or the sha/repo could not be checked at all.

  --json  print one JSON object (verdict, observed id, surface, reason, UTC
          observation time) for a board post or a handback `Verify:` line.

Leakage: a rejected build-id value is reported by type and length only, and
every printed URL (the surface, a redirect Location, a URL remote) drops its
userinfo, query, and fragment. A --url carrying userinfo is refused.

Exit codes: 0 PASS; 1 FAIL (the surface serves / the branch holds something
else); 2 COULD_NOT_CHECK (no build id, non-200, redirect, network or git
error, a timeout, a shallow clone, an ambiguous or too-short sha, or bad
usage). Exit 2 is never a pass: an unverifiable claim stays unverified.

Side effects: `served` performs HTTP GETs (proxy env vars are honoured);
`ref` runs `git fetch` against the named remote (and `git status` with
--require-clean); `checks` runs read-only `gh api` calls. Nothing else is
written.
