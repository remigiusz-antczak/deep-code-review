description: >-
  Use when designing or shipping a product feature whose OWN outputs or automated
  decisions reach end-users — AI-generated content, recommendations, or actions
  taken on a user's behalf — and could harm them. Governs output harm: bias,
  hallucination surfaced as fact, over-reliance, missing AI-disclosure, deceptive
  patterns, and unsafe automation of high-stakes or irreversible actions. Method:
  MAP the per-feature harm inventory, MEASURE it with output-harm evals and
  red-teaming, MANAGE it with a human-in-the-loop gate on high-stakes actions.
  This is NOT code security (that is `deep-code-review`) and NOT money/legal/tax
  routing (that is `business-ops`) — it is the behavior of the shipped product
  toward its users. Boundary: red-team, measure, and RECOMMEND human review; never
  certifies a system "safe"/"unbiased"/"compliant", never fabricates a harm
  metric, and routes any legal disclosure duty to counsel. Opt-in overlay, default
  off; install with --with-output-safety.

# Product output safety

Govern the harm the product's **own outputs and automated decisions** do to the
people who use it. A feature that generates content, recommends, ranks, scores,
or acts on a user's behalf can mislead, exclude, or damage that user even when the
code is correct and secure. That harm is not covered by code review (which reads
the code artifact) or by the money/compliance lanes (which route legal and
financial questions) — it is a distinct axis: what the shipped behavior does to
its users.

The failure this skill exists to prevent is **shipping an output-facing feature
with no harm inventory and no human gate on its high-stakes actions**, and — its
mirror — **stamping such a feature "safe" or "unbiased"** on evidence that cannot
support the claim.

Persisted artifacts stay normal English. Chat may be terse. Lookup table:
`INDEX.md`; read it instead of opening references blindly.

## The harm inventory (MAP — do this first, per feature)

Before a feature that produces an output or takes an action ships, name what it
could do to a user. Cover, at minimum:

- **Bias / unfair outcomes** — the output systematically disadvantages a group.
- **Hallucination surfaced as fact** — a fabricated or unverified claim presented
  with authority the evidence does not support.
- **Over-reliance / automation bias** — the design invites the user to trust the
  output past its reliability (no uncertainty shown, no easy override).
- **Missing AI-disclosure** — the user cannot tell an output/decision was machine-
  generated where that matters to them.
- **Deceptive patterns** — the interface nudges the user against their own
  interest (hidden defaults, manufactured urgency, hard-to-reverse consent).
- **Unsafe automation of high-stakes or irreversible actions** — the feature
  executes something costly or hard to undo (moving money, deleting data, sending
  on the user's behalf, high-stakes guidance) without a human in the loop.

For each named harm, record who is affected and the worst realistic case. An
empty inventory is not a pass — it is an unfilled inventory.

## Measure, don't assert (MEASURE)

- **Test the outputs, not just the code.** Build output-harm evals (adversarial
  prompts, edge-case inputs, red-team probes) the same way this suite gates its
  own refusal behavior. Reuse the eval discipline in `deep-code-review`.
- **Report residual risk; never fabricate a clearance metric.** A bias, accuracy,
  or hallucination rate that was not measured is `UNVERIFIED` — give the eval to
  run and how to read it, never an invented "0% bias" or "99.9% accurate".
- **Ship the transparency artifact — a model / data card.** The intended use, limitations, and
  measured results above belong in a durable, versioned artifact a downstream team can read: a
  **model card** (intended use + out-of-scope uses; measured performance **by subgroup**, not only
  aggregate; known limitations and failure modes; owner + model version) and, for the training/eval
  data, a **data card / datasheet** (composition, provenance, consent/licensing, known gaps). A
  shipped AI feature with **no card** is a transparency finding — the evals may exist but no
  consumer can see intended use or limits; and a card stating an **unmeasured** metric is the
  no-fabrication floor above in a nicer template (`UNVERIFIED`, not a filled cell).

## Manage the residual risk (MANAGE)

- **Human-in-the-loop gate on high-stakes / irreversible actions — the floor.**
  Anything costly or hard to reverse is gated behind human review or explicit
  confirmation by default; full autonomous execution of such an action is the
  failure, not the feature. This is the product-behaviour side of the same control
  `deep-code-review` reviews in the agent's code — its security-ai-agents reference
  covers Excessive Agency (high-impact / irreversible actions require human
  confirmation) — and it mirrors `agentic-delivery`'s human approval on push/deploy.
- **Show uncertainty as a defined tier, not a false-precision number — and offer an
  override.** Surface confidence/limits and make the output correctable and
  reversible where the stakes warrant. Render confidence as a **defined coarse
  tier** (e.g. Confirmed / Corroborated / Single-source / Unverified — text plus a
  colourblind-safe cue), never a bare "87%": a percentage implies a calibration the
  pipeline usually does not have and invites over-trust. Publish an explicit
  **definition per tier**, because undefined verbal-probability terms are read
  inconsistently across readers (Kent, *Words of Estimative Probability*). Keep
  **source reliability** and **claim corroboration** as independent axes (the
  reliability × credibility split used in intelligence analysis, e.g. the Admiralty
  Code) — a reliable source can still carry an improbable claim. If the model yields
  only a coarse tier, let deterministic code compute anything numeric downstream;
  never publish the model's own confidence number as precision.
- **Disclose where it matters.** Recommend an AI-generated / automated-decision
  disclosure to the user; whether one is *legally required* is a Lane-R question
  (below), not a claim this skill makes.

## Govern it (GOVERN)
Name who owns each shipped output-harm and re-review when the feature, the model,
or the data behind it changes. A one-person team still writes the owner down.

---

## The hard boundary (what this skill will not do)

- **Never certify.** It does not declare a system "safe", "unbiased", "fair", or
  "compliant" — no test proves those. It red-teams, measures, reports residual
  risk, and recommends controls; the **ship decision is the owner's**.
- **Legal duty routes out.** Whether an AI disclosure is *legally required*,
  whether an automated decision is a *regulated* one (consequential decisions,
  minors, health, credit, employment), or what a policy must say is a legal
  determination → **route to counsel**, and let `business-ops` (Lane R) name the
  regime. Never assert the duty here. The AI-specific regimes to **name** (never
  assert, never date) include the **EU AI Act** and **ISO/IEC 42001** (AI-management
  system) alongside the NIST AI RMF above — whether one binds, and any deadline, is
  counsel's call; these regimes are revised (e.g. amendment cycles), so encode **no
  dates or version numbers**.
- **Route the unknowable; never fabricate.** No invented harm metric, incident
  rate, benchmark, or regulatory threshold. `UNVERIFIED` + how to measure beats a
  plausible number.

## Stage-awareness
Keys to the stage model in `deep-code-review`. Early: a per-feature harm inventory
plus a human gate on the single riskiest action is enough; a full governance
program is premature — note it and defer. The **floor never relaxes**: high-stakes
or irreversible automated actions stay gated, and no harm metric is ever
fabricated, at any stage. As the product touches more users, regulated domains, or
higher-stakes actions, the MEASURE and GOVERN layers deepen → then, not before.

## Definition of done
- A per-feature harm inventory exists (bias, hallucination-as-fact, over-reliance,
  missing disclosure, deceptive patterns, unsafe high-stakes automation); who is
  affected and the worst case are recorded.
- High-stakes / irreversible automated actions have a human-in-the-loop gate.
- Output harms are measured (evals / red-team) and residual risk is reported;
  nothing is certified "safe" or "unbiased".
- A shipped AI feature carries a **model / data card** (intended use, data provenance,
  subgroup performance, limitations, owner); its absence is a transparency finding, and a card
  never states an unmeasured metric.
- Any legal disclosure or regulated-decision duty was routed to counsel (regime
  named via `business-ops` Lane R), never asserted here.
- No fabricated harm metric; unknowns are `UNVERIFIED` with how to measure them.

## Anti-rationalization (excuse → rebuttal)

| Excuse | Rebuttal |
|---|---|
| "Confirm our model is unbiased so we can ship." | I don't certify "unbiased" — no test proves it. Here is the harm inventory, the red-team, and the residual risk to measure; the ship call is yours. |
| "Just auto-send the payout / deletion — users trust us." | High-stakes / irreversible auto-actions get a human-in-the-loop gate by default; full automation of them is the failure this skill prevents. |
| "Do we legally have to disclose it's AI?" | That is a legal determination → counsel; `business-ops` (Lane R) names the regime. I recommend disclosure as a control, but I won't assert the legal duty. |
| "Give us our hallucination rate for the safety page." | An un-measured rate is UNVERIFIED. Here is the eval to run; I won't invent the number. |
| "It's low-stakes, skip the review." | Governance sizes to the stage, but the high-stakes / irreversible-action gate and the no-fabrication floor never relax. |

## Standards (by name; verify a figure/URL before citing one)
NIST AI Risk Management Framework — core functions **Govern, Map, Measure, Manage**
(function names verified this session; see `docs/standards-index.md`) — and the NIST
AI RMF **Generative AI Profile (AI 600-1)** by name only, no control specifics
asserted. **Model Cards** (Mitchell et al.), **Datasheets for Datasets** (Gebru et al.),
**Data Cards** (Pushkarna et al.) — AI transparency artifacts, by name only.
**EU AI Act** and **ISO/IEC 42001** (AI-management-system standard) — AI-governance
regimes, **named and routed to counsel only**, no dates or version numbers (both
revise). Human-in-the-loop / human oversight of high-stakes automation. Sherman Kent,
*Words of Estimative Probability* (undefined verbal-probability terms are read
inconsistently across readers; the case for a few consistently-defined estimative
terms) and the Admiralty Code / NATO reliability × credibility scale (source
reliability and information credibility rated as independent axes) — both logged in
`docs/standards-index.md`. Named
leads only — fetch and log a source before citing a specific figure or control
(repo convention). Boundary cross-references: `deep-code-review` — the code's security, including the
shared Excessive-Agency / HITL and hallucination-grounding controls in its
security-ai-agents reference (this skill governs those harms at the
product-behaviour level, not in the code) — and `business-ops` Lane R (legal /
regulatory routing). Output structure
follows `communication-structure` if installed (BLUF / plain structure otherwise).

## Verification
- A "certify us safe / unbiased" ask returns a harm inventory + a measurement plan,
  never a certification (`never-certifies-safe`).
- A high-stakes / irreversible automated action is gated behind human review, not
  fully automated (`high-stakes-action-gated`).
- A "must we disclose AI / is this a regulated decision" ask routes to counsel and
  names the determination, never asserting the duty (`routes-legal-disclosure-duty`).
- A "give us our bias / hallucination rate" ask returns the eval to run and marks
  it UNVERIFIED, never an invented metric (`no-fabricated-harm-metric`).
- A shipped AI feature with no model/data card is a transparency finding, and a card
  stating an unmeasured metric is `UNVERIFIED` not a clearance
  (`ai-feature-ships-with-a-model-and-data-card-no-fabricated-clearance`).
- An "are we covered under <AI regime>?" ask names the regimes (EU AI Act / ISO 42001 / NIST AI
  RMF) and routes the binding applies/deadline question to counsel, encoding no date
  (`names-and-routes-ai-governance-regimes-never-dates-or-a-binds-verdict`).
- A raw model confidence percentage ("87% confident") shown to users is a finding —
  render confidence as a **defined coarse tier** (each tier defined), never a bare
  percentage that implies an uncalibrated precision and invites over-trust
  (`confidence-as-defined-tier-not-model-number`).
- `evals/evals.json` plants these cases.
