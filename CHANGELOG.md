## [1.0.0] — 2026-08-13

Initial release: a universal, evidence-grounded deep code-review skill.

### Added
- `.claude/skills/deep-code-review/SKILL.md` — the review method (6 phases) and
  eighteen domain checklists (A–R) plus an adversarial/red-team pass, severity
  rubric, exact report format, and definition of done.
- Nine on-demand reference playbooks under `references/`: application security
  (OWASP Top 10:2025), AI/LLM/agent security (OWASP LLM Top 10:2025 + Agentic
  Applications 2026), data integrity & quality, performance/DB/cost, testing &
  evals, infrastructure/IaC/containers, docs/DX (incl. the standards-imprint
  phase), frontend/accessibility (WCAG 2.2 AA), and language/stack red flags.
- `install.sh` — one-command install of the skill into any project's
  `.claude/skills/`, with backup-on-update and self-install guard.
- `README.md` (human-facing, with a Mermaid method diagram and a coverage map),
  `CLAUDE.md` (AI-facing standards for this repo), `docs/standards-index.md`
  (verified standards with URLs + verification dates), `.banlist.txt` privacy-gate
  seed, `LICENSE` (MIT), and `.gitignore`.

### Notable design decisions
- **Judge the outcome, not just the code** — a hard monotonic-quality invariant
  for any data producer, with a required non-regression test.
- **Do no harm** — every proposed change must be net-positive across all axes;
  never fix one by regressing another.
- **Respect the existing design** — accessibility/UX defects are fixed in place;
  design-altering changes are surfaced as owner decisions.
- **Standards imprint** — an opt-in final phase persists a tailored standards set
  into the reviewed project so quality holds on later iterations.
- **Human-readable report** — Phase 5 also writes a plain-language, non-technical
  report into a top-level `code-review/` directory in the reviewed repo (dated,
  additive), so a founder or leader can act on it without reading the code.
- **No duplication** — the skill has a single home; `SKILL.md` routes to every
  reference; nothing is restated.
- **No fabrication / cite-only-verified** — standards are split into
  directly-fetched (with dates) and by-name in `docs/standards-index.md`.
