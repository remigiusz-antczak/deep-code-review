# Standards index

Every standard the skill relies on, split into what was **verified by direct
fetch** for this release and what is **referenced by name** (not fetched — verify
the current version before citing a specific URL). This split enforces the skill's
own rule: cite only URLs you have verified.

**Last link-rot re-verification: 2026-09-18** — every cited URL was re-fetched and
confirmed live and content-accurate, except five fixed in that pass: 1 dead (the OWASP
ASVS project page → 404, repointed to the ASVS repo) and 4 moved (OWASP Top 10:2025,
its A03 detail, OWASP API Security 2023, and the GitHub Actions security page → their
new canonical hosts, cited content verbatim-intact). Original verification dates below
are unchanged (they record first verification); only the five fixed URLs were touched.

Verification date for all direct fetches below: **2026-08-13**.

## Verified by direct fetch (2026-08-13)

| Standard | URL | What was confirmed |
|---|---|---|
| OWASP Top 10:2025 | https://top10.owasp.org/2025 | Categories A01–A10:2025 verbatim (A01 Broken Access Control … A10 Mishandling of Exceptional Conditions). |
| OWASP Top 10 for LLM Applications 2025 | https://genai.owasp.org/llm-top-10/ | LLM01–LLM10:2025 names verbatim. A 2026 edition now exists (verified 2026-08-21; see the verification addendum below). |
| OWASP Top 10 for LLM Applications 2025 (resource) | https://genai.owasp.org/resource/owasp-top-10-for-llm-applications-2025/ | Edition landing page; document publication 2024-11-17. |
| OWASP Top 10 for Agentic Applications 2026 | https://genai.owasp.org/resource/owasp-top-10-for-agentic-applications-for-2026/ | Framework exists; published 2025-12-09; peer-reviewed by 100+ practitioners. (ASI01–ASI10 titles later confirmed verbatim from the official 2025-12-09 announcement — see the 2026-08-21 addendum below; the authoritative PDF was not re-fetched and wins on any conflict.) |
| OWASP API Security Top 10 (2023) | https://api-security.owasp.org/editions/2023/en/0x11-t10 | API1–API10:2023 names verbatim. |
| CWE-502 — Deserialization of Untrusted Data | https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/502.html | Deserializing attacker- or otherwise-untrusted serialized data. Security face: can enable RCE (never auto-deserialize untrusted input — `security-appsec.md` A08). Data-integrity face: a parser weaker than its builder reintroduces a fabricated value across serialize→parse — re-derive computed fields + validate element shape, never trust the serialized form (`data-quality.md`). Stable identifier; by-name. |
| CWE Top 25 (2025) | https://cwe.mitre.org/top25/archive/2025/2025_cwe_top25.html | Official 2025 edition, last updated 2025-12-15; top entries (XSS, SQLi, CSRF, Missing Authorization, OOB Write, Path Traversal, Use-After-Free, OOB Read, OS Command Injection, Code Injection). |
| WCAG 2.2 | https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/ | W3C Recommendation, dated 2024-12-12; conformance levels A/AA/AAA; WCAG 3.0 still in development. |
| EU Accessibility Act (EAA) — Directive (EU) 2019/882 | https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/dir/2019/882/oj | "Directive (EU) 2019/882 … on the accessibility requirements for products and services." Covers consumer digital surfaces on the EU market — e-commerce, consumer banking / payment terminals, passenger-transport ticketing & self-service, e-readers, computers / operating systems. (The directive mandates functional accessibility requirements to be met via future harmonised standards; it does **not** name EN 301 549 or WCAG on this page — those appear in the skill body as engineering leads *by name only*, not sourced here.) In-scope / micro-enterprise exemption / timelines routed to counsel (not encoded). Fetched 2026-09-19. |
| EU NIS2 Directive — Directive (EU) 2022/2555 | https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/dir/2022/2555/oj | "Directive (EU) 2022/2555 … on measures for a high common level of cybersecurity across the Union … repealing Directive (EU) 2016/1148" (NIS2). Applies to medium-sized+ **essential** and **important** entities across covered sectors (energy, transport, digital infrastructure, cloud / data centres / DNS, online marketplaces / search / social networks, health, drinking/waste water, public administration, space, postal, trust services; financial entities fall under DORA, Regulation (EU) 2022/2554). The preamble previews risk-management-measure categories — risk assessment, incident handling, access control, basic cyber hygiene (zero-trust, updates, segmentation, identity/access), training, and physical/environmental security; the full measure set (including business continuity and supply-chain security) and the staged incident-reporting windows were **not** pinned down in the fetch and are cited by name only (reporting is to "the CSIRT, the competent authority or the single point of contact"). In-scope / essential-vs-important / authority / timelines / management accountability routed to counsel (not encoded). Fetched 2026-09-19. |
| W3C Global Privacy Control (GPC) | https://w3c.github.io/gpc/ | "a mechanism for expressing a person's general universal preference for a do-not-sell-or-share interaction in HTTP requests" — the `Sec-GPC` request header (value `1`) + the `navigator.globalPrivacyControl` boolean; excludes deletion / same-context use; "at least four states have specifically identified GPC as a valid means to exercise legal opt-out rights" (legal force jurisdiction-specific → route to counsel). Fetched 2026-09-19. |
| W3C Internationalization — authoring techniques | https://www.w3.org/International/techniques/authoring-html | "Choose UTF-8 for all content" + always declare encoding in-document; declare `lang` and `dir="rtl"`, "tightly wrap every opposite-direction phrase in markup that sets its base direction"; NFC recommended for identifiers. Fetched 2026-09-19. |
| Unicode UAX #15 — Normalization Forms | https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr15/ | Unicode 18.0.0 (2026-08-12); NFC/NFD/NFKC/NFKD; "None of the Normalization Forms are closed under string concatenation … even if two strings X and Y are normalized, their string concatenation X+Y is not guaranteed to be normalized." Fetched 2026-09-19. |
| Unicode UAX #9 — Bidirectional Algorithm | https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr9/ | Unicode 18.0.0 (2026-09-01); explicit directional-formatting controls — overrides (RLO/LRO), isolates (RLI/LRI/FSI/PDI, the safer mechanism), terminators (PDF/PDI); the overrides "are to be avoided wherever possible, because of security concerns" (see UTR #36 — the Trojan-Source class). Fetched 2026-09-19. |
| Unicode UTS #39 — Security Mechanisms | https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr39/ | Unicode 18.0.0; a stable UTS, citable as a normative reference. §4 Confusable Detection — the *skeleton* algorithm ("The strings X and Y are defined to be confusable if and only if skeleton(X) = skeleton(Y)"), single- / mixed- / whole-script confusables; §5.1 mixed-script detection (a string is mixed-script if its *resolved script set* is empty); §5.2 restriction levels (ASCII-Only / Single Script / Highly Restrictive / Moderately Restrictive / Minimally Restrictive / Unrestricted). Backs the confusable/homograph trust-signal check. Fetched 2026-09-19. |
| Unicode UAX #29 — Text Segmentation | https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr29/ | Unicode 18.0.0; a stable Standard Annex, integral to the Unicode Standard. §3 Grapheme Cluster Boundaries — the *extended grapheme cluster* may span multiple code points (base + combining marks, ZWJ emoji sequences, Hangul jamo); "user-perceived character counts … should correspond to the number of segments delimited by grapheme cluster boundaries" (the formal boundary spec is §3.1 / §3.1.1). Backs the grapheme-safe truncation/count check. Fetched 2026-09-19. |
| RFC 8259 — JSON Data Interchange Format | https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8259 | Internet Standard STD 90. §6 Numbers: "good interoperability can be achieved by implementations that expect no more precision or range than [IEEE 754 binary64] provide," and integers "in the range [-(2**53)+1, (2**53)-1] are interoperable in the sense that implementations will agree exactly on their numeric values." Backs the "integer past 2^53 is silently rounded across a JSON boundary" check. Fetched 2026-09-19. |
| RFC 8594 — The Sunset HTTP Header Field | https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8594 | Informational (current, not obsoleted; May 2019). Defines the `Sunset` response header — a single HTTP-date signaling that "a URI is likely to become unresponsive at a specified point in the future" (a hint, not a guarantee) — plus a `sunset` link relation. Does NOT define a `Deprecation` header (a separate RFC, cited by name only). Backs the machine-readable deprecation-window signal in the API breaking-change discipline. Fetched 2026-09-19. |
| PostgreSQL + MySQL docs — transaction isolation & DDL locking | https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/transaction-iso.html | PostgreSQL default isolation is **Read Committed** ("Read Committed is the default isolation level in PostgreSQL"); lost update / write skew are not prevented there without `SELECT … FOR UPDATE` / a higher level; SERIALIZABLE — "applications … must be prepared to retry transactions due to serialization failures" (SQLSTATE `40001`). MySQL/InnoDB default is **REPEATABLE READ** (dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.4/en/innodb-transaction-isolation-levels.html). `ALTER TABLE` acquires `ACCESS EXCLUSIVE` unless noted (conflicts with all modes) — but `ADD FOREIGN KEY` takes only the weaker `SHARE ROW EXCLUSIVE`; `ADD CONSTRAINT … NOT VALID` + `VALIDATE CONSTRAINT` (`SHARE UPDATE EXCLUSIVE`) and `CREATE UNIQUE INDEX CONCURRENTLY` are the low-lock forms (sql-altertable.html). Head-of-line queue blocking is the lock-manager wait-queue rule — "granted immediately if it does not conflict with any existing or waiting lock request" (`src/backend/storage/lmgr/README`). `ADD COLUMN` cost (same page, sql-altertable.html), verbatim: a non-volatile default is metadata-only — "making the `ALTER TABLE` very fast even on large tables … In neither case is a rewrite of the table required"; only "a volatile `DEFAULT` (e.g., `clock_timestamp()`), a stored generated column, an identity column, or a column with a domain data type that has constraints will cause the entire table and its indexes to be rewritten" (a virtual generated column never does). Five pages fetched 2026-09-19; `ADD COLUMN` rewrite-trigger lines re-verified 2026-09-21. |
| MDN Web Docs — web frontend security (4 pages) | https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/postMessage | Four pages, each fetched 2026-09-19 — postMessage (`/docs/Web/API/Window/postMessage`), Subresource Integrity (`/docs/Web/Security/Subresource_Integrity`), Referrer-Policy (`/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/Referrer-Policy`), Trusted Types API (`/docs/Web/API/Trusted_Types_API`). `Window.postMessage` — "always verify the sender's identity using the `origin` and possibly `source` properties" (receiver checks `event.origin` + message syntax; CWE-346). Subresource Integrity — an `integrity` hash (sha256/384/512) + `crossorigin` lets the browser refuse a CDN-altered resource. Referrer-Policy — controls the `Referer` header; modern default `strict-origin-when-cross-origin` (since the Nov-2020 revision), so the finding is a *weakened* policy or a token-bearing URL. Trusted Types — the `require-trusted-types-for 'script'` CSP directive forces DOM sinks to typed values (Baseline 2026; a tinyfill for older browsers stubs the API but enforces nothing). |
| CWE-1339 — Insufficient Precision or Accuracy of a Real Number | https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/1339.html | "The product processes a real number with an implementation in which the number's representation does not preserve required accuracy and precision in its fractional part, causing an incorrect result." Taxonomy anchor for precision-loss-at-a-boundary; does NOT cover non-finite (NaN/Infinity) — those are cited as IEEE 754 behavior (see the by-name list), not to this CWE. Fetched 2026-09-19. |
| Unicode CLDR — plural rules | https://cldr.unicode.org/index/cldr-spec/plural-rules | Six plural categories (zero / one / two / few / many / other); "languages vary in how they handle plurals"; `other` is the required default every language has. Fetched 2026-09-19. |
| The Twelve-Factor App — IX Disposability | https://12factor.net/disposability | "For a web process, graceful shutdown is achieved by ceasing to listen on the service port (thereby refusing any new requests), allowing any current requests to finish, and then exiting"; "For a worker process, graceful shutdown is achieved by returning the current job to the work queue"; processes "minimize startup time" and are "robust against sudden death." Backs the graceful-shutdown goal in `reliability-error-handling.md`; the readiness/LB ordering there is this skill's own load-balanced extension, not stated by 12-Factor. Fetched 2026-09-19. |
| Google Engineering Practices — Standard of Code Review | https://google.github.io/eng-practices/review/reviewer/standard.html | Core standard: approve once the change "definitely improves the overall code health," even if imperfect. |
| Diátaxis | https://diataxis.fr/ | Four documentation types: Tutorials, How-to guides, Reference, Explanation. |
| C4 model | https://c4model.com/ | Four abstraction levels: Context, Container, Component, Code. |
| OWASP Top 10:2025 — A03 detail | https://top10.owasp.org/2025/A03_2025-Software_Supply_Chain_Failures | A03 absorbed the former A06:2021 "Vulnerable and Outdated Components"; explicitly covers software that is "vulnerable, unsupported, or out of date"; guidance to upgrade "in a risk-based, timely fashion" and to "deliberately choose which version of a dependency you use and upgrade only when there is need"; names OWASP Dependency-Track / Dependency-Check / retire.js as inventory tools. |
| OpenSSF Scorecard | https://github.com/ossf/scorecard | Automated repo security scorer (0–10 per check). Check names verbatim: `Maintained` (active within ~90 days), `Dependency-Update-Tool` (Dependabot/Renovate present), `Vulnerabilities` (unfixed vulns, via the OSV service), `Pinned-Dependencies`. |
| OSV | https://osv.dev/ | Distributed open-source vulnerability database spanning 40+ package ecosystems (npm, PyPI, Go, Maven, Debian, …); `osv-scanner` scans a lockfile or SBOM and queries by package version or commit hash. |
| Semantic Versioning | https://semver.org/ | MAJOR = "incompatible API changes"; MINOR = "add functionality in a backward compatible manner"; PATCH = "backward compatible bug fixes." |
| GitHub Dependabot — version updates | https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/dependabot/dependabot-version-updates/about-dependabot-version-updates | Opens automated PRs to update dependencies to the latest version "even when they don't have any vulnerabilities"; documented reviewer step is to "check that your tests pass, review the changelog and release notes." (This page did **not** state that Dependabot PRs auto-trigger CI or support grouping — those are not claimed by the skill.) |
| endoflife.date | https://endoflife.date/ | Tracks end-of-life / support-lifecycle dates for 400+ products (programming languages, frameworks, databases, OSes, devices, cloud services); offers an API. |
| CISA KEV (Known Exploited Vulnerabilities catalog) | https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog | CISA "maintains the authoritative source of vulnerabilities that have been exploited in the wild"; guidance: "Organizations should use the KEV catalog as an input to their vulnerability management prioritization framework" (an input to prioritization, not a standalone bar). Fetched 2026-09-18. |
| FIRST EPSS (Exploit Prediction Scoring System) | https://www.first.org/epss/ | "a data-driven machine-learning model that estimates the probability that a published CVE will be exploited in the wild" "in the next 30 days"; complements CVSS (EPSS = likelihood, CVSS = severity); maintained by the EPSS Special Interest Group at FIRST. Cast as an input to focus remediation effort, not a standalone verdict. Fetched 2026-09-18. |
| Package hallucination / slopsquatting (USENIX Security 2025) | https://www.usenix.org/system/files/usenixsecurity25-spracklen.pdf | Spracklen et al., "We Have a Package for You! A Comprehensive Analysis of Package Hallucinations by Code Generating LLMs" — across 576k samples / 16 models, at least 21.7% of packages recommended by open-source models and 5.2% by commercial models were non-existent; 205,474 unique hallucinated names; ~43% recurred on every one of 10 re-runs (a predictable pre-registration target). "Slopsquatting" = an attacker registering a hallucinated name. Verified against the USENIX PDF (fetched 2026-09-19); the authors' GitHub (Spracks/PackageHallucination) corroborates 205,474 names / 576k samples / 16 models and states a 19.7% overall (all-models) hallucination rate. |
| FIRST CVSS (Common Vulnerability Scoring System) | https://www.first.org/cvss/ | "CVSS provides a way to capture the principal characteristics of a vulnerability and produce a numerical score reflecting its severity"; currently v4.0; maintained by FIRST. Severity (how bad) — distinct from EPSS's exploitation likelihood and KEV's exploited-in-the-wild fact. Fetched 2026-09-18. |

Reference repository reviewed for patterns (not a standard):
`nickmaglowsch/claude-setup` — https://github.com/nickmaglowsch/claude-setup
(diff-scoped review packets; a decorrelated cross-model second opinion on
sensitive diffs — auth, payments, crypto, concurrency, DB migrations).

## Verified by direct fetch (2026-08-14) — meta-review additions

Verification date for the rows below: **2026-08-14**. Added while extending the
skill's documentation/DX, repository-hygiene, cross-agent-portability, and
durable-standards coverage.

| Standard / source | URL | What was confirmed |
|---|---|---|
| GitHub community health files | https://docs.github.com/en/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/about-community-profiles-for-public-repositories | Recommended community-health files: README, CODE_OF_CONDUCT, LICENSE, CONTRIBUTING, SECURITY, and issue + pull-request templates; issue templates must live in `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE`. (Folder precedence for other files, and "LICENSE must be in-repo," were **not** reproduced on this fetch — not asserted by the skill.) |
| OpenSSF Best Practices Badge (passing criteria) | https://www.bestpractices.dev/en/criteria/0 | Passing-level **MUST** items used as hygiene checks: a FLOSS license posted in a standard location; a published process for reporting vulnerabilities; per-release human-readable release notes; at least one automated test suite. Documented contribution requirements is **SHOULD**, not MUST. |
| OpenSSF Scorecard — checks catalog | https://github.com/ossf/scorecard/blob/f92023a3f77879f96e0c9c1305f289d755be4bb6/docs/checks.md | Verbatim check descriptions: Branch-Protection ("default and release branches are protected"), Code-Review ("requires human code review before pull requests … are merged"), CI-Tests ("runs tests before pull requests are merged"), License, Security-Policy, Maintained. (Distinct from the Scorecard repo-root row above.) (SHA-pinned f92023a; re-verified 2026-09-21) |
| AGENTS.md | https://agents.md/ | "A simple, open format for guiding coding agents" — a cross-vendor Markdown file at the repo root; nested files take precedence for their subprojects. (No adoption count or governing body asserted.) |
| Claude Code — memory / CLAUDE.md | https://code.claude.com/docs/en/memory | CLAUDE.md and auto-memory are "context, not enforced configuration. To block an action regardless of what Claude decides, use a PreToolUse hook instead." Claude Code reads `CLAUDE.md`, not `AGENTS.md`; bridge an existing `AGENTS.md` via an `@AGENTS.md` import or `ln -s AGENTS.md CLAUDE.md`. Project file at `./CLAUDE.md` or `./.claude/CLAUDE.md`. |
| pre-commit | https://pre-commit.com/ | "A framework for managing and maintaining multi-language pre-commit hooks." Config `.pre-commit-config.yaml`; installed with `pre-commit install`; runs on staged files before a commit completes. |
| Development Containers | https://containers.dev/ | A dev container "allows you to use a container as a full-featured development environment" for consistency across local/remote/CI. (Exact config-file path not asserted.) |
| github/scripts-to-rule-them-all | https://github.com/github/scripts-to-rule-them-all | Normalized script names (`script/bootstrap`, `setup`, `update`, `server`, `test`, `cibuild`, `console`) so contributors "only need to know the pattern"; goal: contribute "without first learning how to bootstrap the project or how to get its tests to run." |
| EditorConfig | https://editorconfig.org/ | `.editorconfig` standardizes indent style/size, charset, end-of-line, trailing-whitespace, and final-newline across editors/IDEs. |
| Keep a Changelog 1.1.0 | https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/ | `CHANGELOG.md`; "Changelogs are for humans, not machines"; an `Unreleased` section; categories Added / Changed / Deprecated / Removed / Fixed / Security; newest version first. |

## Verified by direct fetch (2026-08-14) — branch & merge triage additions

Verification date for the rows below: **2026-08-14**. Added for the branch,
merge & open-work triage capability (`references/branch-and-merge-hygiene.md`,
`SKILL.md` domain S). The `git` enumeration commands were additionally validated
this session against a scratch repository covering normal-merge, single- and
multi-commit squash-merge, rebase-merge, stale-unmerged, diverged, and
deleted-remote branches.

| Standard / source | URL | What was confirmed |
|---|---|---|
| Trunk-Based Development | https://trunkbaseddevelopment.com/ | "developers collaborate on code in a single branch called 'trunk' and resist any pressure to create other long-lived development branches"; "all team members commit to trunk at least once every 24 hours"; short-lived review branches "should only last a couple of days" — beyond two days risks "a long-lived feature branch (the antithesis of trunk-based development)." No `develop` branch. |
| GitHub flow | https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-github/github-flow | Six ordered steps — create a branch → make changes → create a pull request → address review comments → merge your pull request → delete your branch — merging into "the default branch." The current docs contain **no** "main is always deployable" / deploy / production language (verified against the primary `github/docs` markdown); that property is attestable only via GitLab characterizing GitHub flow, not GitHub's own page. |
| GitHub — Linking a pull request to an issue | https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/using-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue | Auto-close is default-branch-scoped: "When you merge a linked pull request into the default branch of a repository, its linked issue is automatically closed"; the closing keywords (close/closes/closed, fix/fixes/fixed, resolve/resolves/resolved) are "interpreted only when the pull request targets the repository's default branch." Fetched 2026-09-18. |
| GitLab flow | https://about.gitlab.com/topics/version-control/what-is-gitlab-flow/ | "all features and fixes go to the `main` branch while enabling `production` and `stable` branches"; a pre-production branch takes bug fixes before production; "Commits flow downstream to ensure that every line of code is tested in all environments." The **"upstream first"** phrasing is confirmed from GitLab's archived FOSS docs (`gitlab-foss` `doc/workflow/gitlab_flow.md`, pinned commit, uses `master`), not this page; `docs.gitlab.com/topics/gitlab_flow/` returned a 302 to an auth endpoint this session and was not retrieved. |
| git-flow branching model (Vincent Driessen) | https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/ | Two long-lived branches — `master` ("production-ready state") + `develop` ("latest delivered development changes for the next release"); feature branches "Must merge back into: develop"; plus release and hotfix branches. Author's 2020 note: for continuous delivery "adopt a much simpler workflow (like GitHub flow) instead of trying to shoehorn git-flow." (Original uses `master`.) |
| Patterns for Managing Source Code Branches (M. Fowler) | https://martinfowler.com/articles/branching-patterns.html | Mainline = "A single, shared, branch that acts as the current state of the product"; Continuous Integration integrates to mainline "usually less than a day's work"; Feature Branching integrates "when the feature is complete"; smaller/more-frequent integrations carry "less risk," and "Branches inevitably diverge," making later merges harder. (The exact phrase "merge debt" does **not** appear on the page.) |
| GitHub — About merge methods on GitHub | https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/configuring-pull-request-merges/about-merge-methods-on-github | Merge commit (default): "all commits from the feature branch are added to the base branch in a merge commit" (uses `--no-ff`). Squash: "the pull request's commits are squashed into a single commit" for "a more streamlined Git history." Rebase: commits "added onto the base branch individually without a merge commit … resembles a fast-forward merge by maintaining a linear project history." An admin "can enforce one type of merge method … by only enabling the desired method." |
| GitHub — About protected branches | https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/managing-protected-branches/about-protected-branches | Branch protection rules "define whether collaborators can delete or force push to the branch and set requirements for any pushes"; named settings incl. "Require pull request reviews before merging," "Require status checks before merging," "Require linear history," "Require merge queue," "Allow force pushes," "Allow deletions." |
| GitHub — Managing a branch protection rule | https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/managing-protected-branches/managing-a-branch-protection-rule | Settings labelled "Require a pull request before merging," "Require approvals," "Require status checks to pass before merging," "Do not allow bypassing the above settings," "Restrict who can push to matching branches." (Verbatim labels differ from the About-protected-branches page; attributed separately.) |
| GitHub — Managing a merge queue | https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/configuring-pull-request-merges/managing-a-merge-queue | "A merge queue helps increase velocity by automating pull request merges into a busy branch and ensuring the branch is never broken by incompatible changes"; each PR is grouped "with the latest version of the `base_branch` as well as changes from pull requests ahead of it in the queue"; required via the "Require merge queue" protection setting. |
| GitHub — Managing the automatic deletion of branches | https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/configuring-pull-request-merges/managing-the-automatic-deletion-of-branches | "You can have head branches automatically deleted after pull requests are merged"; "Branch protection rules and repository rules can also prevent branches being automatically deleted." |
| GitHub — Deleting and restoring branches in a pull request | https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/managing-branches-in-your-repository/deleting-and-restoring-branches-in-a-pull-request | A branch associated with a merged/closed PR can be deleted; "You can restore the head branch of a closed pull request." |
| git reference manual — branch / log / cherry / for-each-ref | https://git-scm.com/docs/git-branch · https://git-scm.com/docs/git-log · https://git-scm.com/docs/git-cherry · https://git-scm.com/docs/git-for-each-ref | `--merged [<commit>]` / `--no-merged [<commit>]` list branches whose tips **are / are not** reachable from `<commit>`. `git log <base>..<branch>` = commits reachable from `<branch>` but not `<base>`. `git cherry` = "Find commits yet to be applied to upstream" (prefix `-` = an equivalent is already upstream, `+` = not). `git for-each-ref --sort=committerdate refs/heads` orders local branches by last-commit date (`committerdate` is a numeric sort key; `-` prefix reverses). |

## Verified by direct fetch (2026-08-17) — ASVS

Verification date: **2026-08-17**.

| Standard / source | URL | What was confirmed |
|---|---|---|
| OWASP ASVS | https://github.com/OWASP/ASVS | Latest stable version **5.0.0** (dated May 2025). Preferred requirement id form `v<version>-<chapter>.<section>.<requirement>` (e.g. `v5.0.0-1.2.5`); a bare `1.2.5` refers to the latest version. Use as a verification checklist — claiming "ASVS covered" in a review requires naming the exact chapters/requirements actually checked, not a bare "ASVS" label. (Repointed 2026-09-18 from the retired `owasp.org/www-project-application-security-verification-standard/`, now 404; ASVS 5.0's assurance-level model for **V7 (Session Management)** was re-verified by direct fetch of the `v5.0.0_release` spec on 2026-09-20 — 7.3.1 = L2, 7.3.2 = L2, 7.4.1 = L1, matching this repo's `security-appsec.md` citations; other chapters/levels not cited here remain unverified — check the 5.0 spec before citing them.) |

## Verified by direct fetch (2026-08-17) — install / Cursor portability

Verification date for the row below: **2026-08-17**. Added for `install.sh
--with-cursor` and global `~/.cursor/skills/` installs.

Each skill is a folder with `SKILL.md` (YAML `name` + `description`); optional `references/`, `scripts/`, `assets/`. |

## Verified by direct fetch (2026-08-21) — WCAG success-criteria details

Verification date for the rows below: **2026-08-21**. Added for the a11y
gate-vs-standard rule (`SKILL.md` Phase 1) and the cross-view consistency pass
(`references/frontend-a11y.md`). Each row fetched from its W3C "Understanding"

Inactive-component exception, verbatim: text/images of text "that are part of an inactive user interface component … have no contrast requirement"; inactive = "not available for user interaction (e.g., a disabled control in HTML)." Basis for "a contrast gate flagging disabled controls is stricter than its standard." |
| WCAG 2.2 SC 3.2.4 Consistent Identification | https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/consistent-identification.html | Level AA. Requirement verbatim: "Components that have the same functionality within a set of web pages are identified consistently." Basis for the same-action-two-labels cross-view finding. |
| WCAG 2.2 SC 3.2.6 Consistent Help | https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/consistent-help.html | Level A; new in WCAG 2.2. Repeated help mechanisms (human contact details/mechanism, self-help, automated contact) "occur in the same order relative to other page content, unless a change is initiated by the user." Sibling criterion for help/contact placement. |

## Verified by direct fetch (2026-09-08) — software-house roles & agent orchestration

Verification date for the rows below: **2026-09-08**. Added for the delivery
role roster (`agentic-delivery/references/roles.md`), the evaluator/adversary
framing (`idea-critic`), and the orchestration discipline (worktree isolation,
preflight, render-surface discriminator) in `agentic-delivery` and
`references/parallel-audit.md`. Each row fetched this session; where a claim was
not on the fetched page, the row says so.

| Standard / source | URL | What was confirmed |
|---|---|---|
| Anthropic — Building Effective AI Agents | https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/building-effective-agents | Published 2024-12-19. Named workflow patterns verbatim: **Prompt chaining**, **Routing**, **Parallelization** ("LLMs work simultaneously on a task and have their outputs aggregated"), **Orchestrator-workers** ("a central LLM dynamically breaks down tasks, delegates them to worker LLMs, and synthesizes their results"), **Evaluator-optimizer** ("one LLM call generates a response while another provides evaluation and feedback in a loop"), and autonomous **Agents**. Guidance: prefer the simplest sufficient structure; add multi-step/agentic complexity only when simpler solutions fall short. |
| Claude Code — Subagents | https://code.claude.com/docs/en/sub-agents | `docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code/sub-agents` 301→ this URL this session. "Each subagent runs in its own context window with a custom system prompt, specific tool access, and independent permissions." Least privilege via a `tools` allowlist or `disallowedTools` denylist. Single-responsibility: "Define a custom subagent when you keep spawning the same kind of worker with the same instructions." Parallelism: "For independent investigations, spawn multiple subagents to work simultaneously." |

Claude Code discovers filesystem Skills in `~/.claude/skills/` (personal) or `.claude/skills/` (project). "Compose capabilities: Combine Skills for complex, multistep tasks." Security note: use only trusted Skills; externally-fetched content is a risk surface. |
| MetaGPT (Hong et al.) | https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.00352 | Title "MetaGPT: Meta Programming for A Multi-Agent Collaborative Framework." Abstract confirmed: it "encodes Standardized Operating Procedures (SOPs) into prompt sequences," assigns "diverse roles to various agents" in "an assembly line paradigm," lets agents "verify intermediate results and reduce errors," and targets "cascading hallucinations caused by naively chaining LLMs." (The specific product-manager/architect/engineer/QA role list is **not** quoted verbatim from the abstract fetched this session.) |
| ChatDev (Qian et al.) | https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.07924 | Title "ChatDev: Communicative Agents for Software Development." Abstract confirmed: specialized LLM-driven agents collaborate across the software lifecycle — "design, coding, and testing" — guided in what to communicate (a chat chain) and how (via "communicative dehallucination"). (Specific role titles such as CEO/CTO and a documentation phase are **not** quoted verbatim from the abstract fetched this session.) |

## Verified by direct fetch (2026-09-08) — model-tiering, release engineering & retrospectives

Verification date for the rows below: **2026-09-08**. Added for
`references/model-tiering.md`, `references/release-engineering.md`,
`agentic-delivery/references/retrospective.md` + `template-postmortem.md` +
`template-adr.md`, the G0 appetite line, and the §8 spike/prototype-branch
convention in `branch-and-merge-hygiene.md`.

| Standard / source | URL | What was confirmed |
|---|---|---|
| Claude docs — Choosing the right model | https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/about-claude/models/choosing-a-model | Names the three-tier model family and the general guidance to match model strength to task complexity rather than run everything on the strongest tier. |
| Claude docs — Optimizing for cost and intelligence | https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/about-claude/models/optimizing-for-cost-and-intelligence | Source for `model-tiering.md`'s levers: effort/reasoning-depth tuning as a same-model lever; prefix/prompt caching as the largest single cost lever on an agentic task (cost grows roughly with the square of turn count without it); the Batch API as a flat discount for unattended work; escalate-on-failure (cheap-first, re-run failures at full strength) reaching comparable pass rate for meaningfully less cost than running everything strong; a per-lane token budget as a direct cost/quality dial; a bounded advisor-consult pattern (a couple of calls per task) as a cheaper alternative to a full model swap, with a measured quality regression if over-used; and judging model choice by cost-per-*solved*-task rather than cost-per-token, since a pricier-per-token model can solve enough more tasks to cost less overall. |
| Claude docs — Prompt caching | https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/prompt-caching | A cached prefix is billed well below fresh input on re-send; supports the "mark the shared fan-out packet cacheable" addition in `parallel-audit.md` §1. |
| Claude docs — Batch processing | https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/batch-processing | Confirms the batch-API discount mechanism for unattended/async work named in `model-tiering.md`. |
| Aider — "Separating code reasoning and editing" | https://aider.chat/2024/09/26/architect.html | 2024-09-26. A production-shipped instance of a strong-model-plans / cheaper-model-executes split (architect/editor mode), cited as prior art for tiering plan vs. execute onto different model strengths — not quoted for specific pass-rate numbers here, since those are model-version-dated and not load-bearing for this skill's vendor-neutral guidance. |
| RouteLLM (Ong, Almahairi, Wu, Chiang, Wu, Gonzalez, Stoica, Zhang) | https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18665 | Demonstrates the general routing principle: dynamically routing between a strong and weak LLM cuts cost substantially without giving up response quality, and a trained router transfers across different strong/weak model pairs at test time — general support for "tier by task, not by default," not a specific number this skill asserts. |
| DORA — Core metrics | https://dora.dev/guides/dora-metrics-four-keys/ | The framework is **five** metrics in two categories: Throughput (change lead time, deployment frequency, failed-deployment recovery time) and Instability (change fail rate, deployment rework rate — the share of deployments that are unplanned but happen as a result of a production incident). **Single-source caveat:** confirmed by direct fetch of this page only; re-verify against a second source before treating these exact names as final, since DORA revises this page over time. |
| DORA — research programme | https://dora.dev/research/ , https://dora.dev/ | A Google Cloud–led research programme; DORA Core is framed as the most firmly-established findings, intended as a practitioner guide. |
| *Accelerate* (Forsgren, Humble, Kim) | https://itrevolution.com/product/accelerate/ | Publisher landing page only — confirms authorship and the State of DevOps report lineage, not a source for specific statistical claims (marketing copy, not the study itself). |
| Martin Fowler — Feature Toggles | https://martinfowler.com/articles/feature-toggles.html | Four categories confirmed verbatim: Release Toggles ("should generally not stick around much longer than a week or two"), Experiment Toggles (A/B/cohort), Ops Toggles (operator kill-switch), Permissioning Toggles (feature by segment). Toggle debt named explicitly: "Savvy teams view the Feature Toggles in their codebase as inventory which comes with a carrying cost." |
| Martin Fowler — Canary Release | https://martinfowler.com/bliki/CanaryRelease.html | Traffic split to a small subset first (random sample / internal users / demographic), widened as confidence grows; names a "cluster immune system" — automatic rollback on business-metric regression, not error rate alone. |
| Martin Fowler — Blue-Green Deployment | https://martinfowler.com/bliki/BlueGreenDeployment.html | Two near-identical environments; cutover is a router flip; rollback is flipping the router back. |
| Google SRE book — Postmortem Culture: Learning from Failure | https://sre.google/sre-book/postmortem-culture/ | Blameless principle verbatim: "assumes that everyone involved in an incident had good intentions and did the right thing with the information they had." Trigger criteria: user-visible downtime/degradation past a threshold, data loss, on-call intervention, resolution time above a threshold, a monitoring failure that delayed detection, or a stakeholder request. |
| Google SRE book — Example Postmortem (Shakespeare Search) | https://sre.google/sre-book/example-postmortem/ | Template section order confirmed: Summary → Impact → Root Causes → Trigger → Resolution → Detection → Action Items → Lessons Learned (what went well / poorly / where we got lucky) → Timeline → Supporting information. Action items carry an owner, a type, and a bug-tracker reference. |
| Google SRE workbook — Alerting on SLOs | https://sre.google/workbook/alerting-on-slos/ | Multiwindow, multi-burn-rate mechanism: for a 99.9% SLO, page at a 14.4× burn rate over 1h/5m windows, page at 6× over 6h/30m, ticket at 1× over 3d/6h — the short window exists so the alert clears minutes after the issue resolves rather than staying hot on stale data. This is the citation for `role-coverage.md`'s existing, previously-uncited burn-rate language; treat this row as adding the source and the exact window/multiplier values, not as an independently re-verified claim that the pre-existing prose matched these numbers line-by-line before this citation was added. |
| Michael Nygard — "Documenting Architecture Decisions" | http://cognitect.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions | The original ADR post. Section set confirmed verbatim: Title (short noun phrase), Context (neutral statement of forces), Decision (full sentences, active voice, "We will…"), Status (proposed/accepted/deprecated/superseded), Consequences (all of them, not just the positive). Numbered sequentially, never reused; "should be one or two pages long." |
| MADR (Markdown Architectural Decision Records) | https://adr.github.io/madr/ | Template headers confirmed: Context and Problem Statement, Decision Drivers (optional), Considered Options, Decision Outcome (with optional Consequences/Confirmation), Pros and Cons of the Options (optional), More Information (optional) — only the first three are core, the rest explicitly removable. |
| Shape Up — Ch.3 "Set Boundaries" (Appetite) | https://basecamp.com/shapeup/1.2-chapter-03 | Verbatim: "An appetite is completely different from an estimate. Estimates start with a design and end with a number. Appetites start with a number and end with a design" — "fixed time, variable scope." Basis for G0's appetite line in `agentic-delivery/SKILL.md`. |
| Shape Up — Ch.4 "Find the Elements" (Breadboarding, Fat Marker Sketches) | https://basecamp.com/shapeup/1.3-chapter-04 | A breadboard "has all the components and wiring of a real device but no industrial design"; a fat marker sketch is deliberately too broad to add detail, so the team can't skip ahead to the wrong fidelity. Cited as the design-side precedent for a disposable-by-construction exploration; `branch-and-merge-hygiene.md` §8 applies the same idea to a branch-naming convention, not to Shape Up's own design ritual. |
| Test Pyramid (Ham Vocke, on Martin Fowler's site) | https://martinfowler.com/articles/practical-test-pyramid.html | 2018-02-26. Three layers bottom-to-top — Unit, Service/Integration, UI/E2E — attributed to Mike Cohn's original pyramid. "Write lots of small and fast unit tests. Write some more coarse-grained tests and very few high-level tests." |
| Testing Trophy (Kent C. Dodds) | https://kentcdodds.com/blog/write-tests | 2019-07-13. Layers bottom-to-top: Static, Unit, Integration, E2E. An explicit, named departure from the classic pyramid's unit-heavy shape — integration tests as the best confidence/speed trade-off for a modern, I/O-heavy app. |

## Verified by direct fetch (2026-09-08) — idea-critic hardening & Conductor operating rhythm

Verification date for the rows below: **2026-09-08**. Added for
`idea-critic/SKILL.md`'s `steelman` / `strongest_attack_survived` /
premortem / model-family-decorrelation additions, and `agentic-delivery/
SKILL.md`'s Conductor operating rhythm subsection.

| Standard / source | URL | What was confirmed |
|---|---|---|
| Anthropic — How we built our multi-agent research system | https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/multi-agent-research-system | 2025-06-13. Verbatim: "Agents typically use about 4× more tokens than chat interactions, and multi-agent systems use about 15× more tokens than chats." Subagents given only "simple, short instructions" were observed duplicating each other's work (two independently re-investigating the same ground); the fix stated is that "each subagent needs an objective, an output format, guidance on the tools and sources to use, and clear task boundaries." Scaling tiers confirmed: 1 agent for simple fact-finding, 2-4 subagents for a direct comparison, 10+ only for a complex, clearly-divided task. Over-parallelization ("spawning 50 subagents for simple queries") named as an observed failure. |
| Anthropic — Effective context engineering for AI agents | https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/effective-context-engineering-for-ai-agents | 2025-09-29. Verbatim, under "Sub-agent architectures": a subagent "returns only a condensed, distilled summary of its work (often 1,000-2,000 tokens)... the detailed search context remains isolated within sub-agents, while the lead agent focuses on synthesizing and analyzing the results." Basis for the Conductor's event-driven, status-only attention model. |
| Claude Code — Best practices for agentic coding | https://code.claude.com/docs/en/best-practices | Verbatim, on adversarial review: "A reviewer prompted to find gaps will usually report some, even when the work is sound, because that is what it was asked to do... Tell the reviewer to flag only gaps that affect correctness or the stated requirements, and treat the rest as optional" — the demand-characteristic bias `idea-critic`'s steelman + `strongest_attack_survived` fields are designed against (force the record to be specific, not merely present). Also verbatim: "a fresh context improves code review since Claude won't be biased toward code it just wrote," cited in `roles.md`'s Independence bullet. |
| MAST — "Why Do Multi-Agent LLM Systems Fail?" (Cemri, Pan, Yang, Agrawal, Chopra, Tiwari, Keutzer, Parameswaran, Klein, Ramchandran, Zaharia, Gonzalez, Stoica) | https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13657 | Submitted 2025-03-17. Abstract confirmed verbatim: three failure categories — "(i) system design issues, (ii) inter-agent misalignment, (iii) task verification" — across 14 unique failure modes and 1600+ annotated traces from 7 open-source multi-agent frameworks. The abstract does **not** enumerate the 14 individual failure-mode names — only the 3 category names are verbatim-confirmed there. **Deepen 2026-09-20:** the full-text HTML rendering (`https://arxiv.org/html/2503.13657` — the unpinned latest version, not the pinned 2025-03-17 submission) was curl-verified this session and **does** enumerate the modes verbatim, e.g. FM-1.3 "Step repetition", FM-1.5 "Unaware of termination conditions", FM-3.2 "No or incomplete verification"; the skill now cites these specific modes for the agent-correctness fold in `security-ai-agents.md`. The abstract-only caveat still holds for the pinned submission version. |
| Nemeth, Brown & Rogers (2001), "Devil's advocate versus authentic dissent: stimulating quantity and quality" | *European Journal of Social Psychology*, 31(6), 707–720. DOI: 10.1002/ejsp.58 | Verified via Crossref bibliographic API (abstract snippet, not full text — publisher returned 403 to direct fetch): "authentic minority was superior to all three forms of 'devil's advocate'" — assigned/manufactured dissent underperformed genuine dissent on stimulating group thought. Treat the mechanism as solidly established; the exact conditions tested and effect sizes are unconfirmed from this session's fetch. |
| Nemeth, C. J. (2018), *In Defense of Troublemakers: The Power of Dissent in Life and Business* | Basic Books. ISBN 978-0465096299 | Verified via Wikipedia's "Devil's advocate" article quoting the book directly: "Inauthentic dissent (assigning someone to act as a Devil's advocate) is considerably less effective in improving group decision-making than authentic dissent," and can leave people "more entrenched in their original beliefs." Secondary paraphrase of a trade book, not a primary journal source — light corroboration for the Nemeth et al. 2001 finding and for `idea-critic`'s false-closure-REVISE pitfall, not standalone grounding. |
| Panickssery, Bowman & Feng (2024), "LLM Evaluators Recognize and Favor Their Own Generations" | https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13076 | "GPT-4 and Llama 2 have non-trivial accuracy at distinguishing themselves from other LLMs and humans," and self-recognition capability correlates with self-preference bias. Tested on GPT-4 and Llama 2 only — **not** Claude; transfer to other model families is a reasonable inference cited as such in `idea-critic`'s Independence step, not an independently tested finding. |
| Pre-mortem (Klein, G. (2007), "Performing a Project Premortem," *Harvard Business Review*, 85(9): 18–19) | Verified via Wikipedia's "Pre-mortem" article, cross-referenced by Kahneman, *Thinking, Fast and Slow* (2011) | A premortem assumes the project has already failed and works backward to explain why — a different elicitation frame from "what might go wrong," credited with increasing the likelihood the main threats get identified. No quantified effect size confirmed from this session's fetch; cited via Wikipedia's citation of the HBR piece, not the piece itself. |

## Verified by direct fetch (2026-09-09) — `agentic-delivery/references/fast-agentic-delivery.md`

Verification date for the rows below: **2026-09-09**. Added for the new concurrency-,
scheduling-, and merge-cadence reference in the `agentic-delivery` skill.

| Standard / source | URL | What was confirmed |
|---|---|---|
| Kanban University, *Kanban Guide* | https://kanban.university/kanban-guide/ | A WIP limit's stated purpose, verbatim: "balance utilization and still ensure the flow of work"; "limiting the work that is allowed to enter the system is an important key to reducing delay and context switching which may result in poor timeliness, quality, and potentially waste"; a WIP limit as "an enabling constraint, which gives focus and develops behaviors such as collaboration and finishing started items with high quality." |
| Google Engineering Practices — Small CLs | https://google.github.io/eng-practices/review/developer/small-cls.html | "100 lines is usually a reasonable size for a CL, and 1000 lines is usually too large, but it's up to the judgment of your reviewer." Small CLs are reviewed more quickly and more thoroughly, introduce fewer bugs ("it's easier for you and your reviewer to reason effectively about the impact"), waste less effort on a wrong direction, and simplify rollback. |
| Wikipedia — Blast radius (computing sense) | https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blast_radius | "In cloud computing, the term blast radius is used to designate the impact that a security breach of one single component of an application could have on the overall composite application." A sibling technical-debt sense: "how many otherwise redundant edits on different scripts would need to be made when changing something small" — the lockstep-surfaces problem named directly. |
| GitLab Docs — Merge trains | https://docs.gitlab.com/ci/pipelines/merge_trains/ | "Use merge trains to put merge requests in a queue. Each merge request is compared to the other, earlier merge requests, to ensure they all work together." Names the problem directly: "two merge requests can each pass their own pipeline, but their combined changes can still conflict." Each queued pipeline runs the change combined with the target branch **and** every earlier queued change (a third queued MR's pipeline tests all three, combined). |
| Brendan Gregg — Linux Load Averages: Solving the Mystery | https://www.brendangregg.com/blog/2017-08-08/linux-load-averages.html | "Adding the uninterruptible state means that Linux load averages can increase due to a disk (or NFS) I/O workload, not just CPU demand." Worked example: "a heavily disk-bound system might be extremely sluggish but only have a TASK_RUNNING [CPU-runnable] average of 0.1"; a decomposed `tar` archival showed a load average of 1.19 including 0.67 from uninterruptible disk reads against only 0.37 actual CPU utilization — the basis for "don't gate concurrency on `load1` alone." |

## Verified by direct fetch (2026-09-10) — dependency cooldown & CI/CD hardening

Verification date for the rows below: **2026-09-10**. Added for the
release-age-cooldown control (`references/dependency-currency-and-upgrades.md`)
and the CI/CD trigger-and-token hardening instrument (`references/security-appsec.md`
A03, cross-referenced from `references/security-agent-skills.md` AST02).

| Standard / source | URL | What was confirmed |
|---|---|---|
| Renovate — `minimumReleaseAge` | https://docs.renovatebot.com/configuration-options/ | Supply-chain cooldown option: "Suppress branch/PR creation for X days" / "Prevent holding broken npm packages"; Renovate delays proposing an update until a package has been public for the configured duration, reducing exposure to newly-published malicious or broken releases. Associated option `minimumReleaseAgeBehaviour`. (Dependabot `cooldown` and npm/pnpm `min-release-age`-style keys were **not** fetched this session — confirm the exact key per ecosystem before citing.) |
| GitHub Actions — Secure use reference | https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/security/secure-use | Privileged workflows (`pull_request_target` / `workflow_run`) share the main-branch cache and may hold write access + secrets, so they "must not explicitly check out untrusted code" (verbatim). For inline scripts, "the preferred approach to handling untrusted input is to set the value of the expression to an intermediate environment variable" rather than inlining `${{ github.event.* }}` into a `run:` script. Set the default `GITHUB_TOKEN` to "read access only for repository contents," escalating per job as required. (`persist-credentials` on `actions/checkout` still **not** on this page. Repointed 2026-09-18 — the page was renamed from "Security hardening for GitHub Actions" to "Secure use reference".) |
| NIST AI Risk Management Framework — core functions (verified 2026-09-11) | https://www.nist.gov/itl/ai-risk-management-framework | The four core function names — **Govern, Map, Measure, Manage** — appear on the official NIST ITL framework page. Only the function names were confirmed here; the full AI RMF 1.0 (AI 100-1) and the Generative AI Profile (AI 600-1) control specifics were **not** fetched this session — cite those by name only (see the by-name list below). |

## Verified by direct fetch (2026-09-13) — agent context/memory lifecycle

Verification date for the rows below: **2026-09-13**. Added for the domain-C
"context & memory lifecycle" review lens (`references/security-ai-agents.md`) and
its 🚩 tells (the non-adversarial sibling to ASI06, plus the LLM06 tree-budget
clause). Each row fetched this session; where a date or claim was not on the

| Anthropic — Effective harnesses for long-running agents | https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/effective-harnesses-for-long-running-agents | Published 2025-11-26. Long-running agents "running out of context in the middle of [an] implementation, leaving the next session to start with a feature half-implemented and undocumented"; mitigations named — a progress file, git history, a feature checklist, and context compaction. Basis for the "constraint/state must survive compaction" lens. Newer than the already-indexed "Effective context engineering" (2025-09-29). |
| Anthropic — Context editing (docs) | https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/context-editing | Undated page. Automatic clearing of the oldest tool results at a token threshold, replaced with placeholder text; strategy `clear_tool_uses_20250919`, option `clear_tool_inputs`; **`exclude_tools`** = "tool names whose tool uses and results should never be cleared. Useful for preserving important context." Basis for "exempt the constraint/authority-bearing result from clearing." |
| Anthropic — Compaction (docs) | https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/compaction | Undated page. "Compaction extends the effective context length … by automatically summarizing older context when approaching the context window limit"; later requests drop content blocks before the `compaction` block. A custom `instructions` string "don't supplement the default prompt. They replace it completely" — basis for "a replacing summary instruction must still carry the constraints." Config `compact_20260112` (seen in a page example). |
| Anthropic — Memory tool (docs) | https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agents-and-tools/tool-use/memory-tool | Undated page. Client-side persistent store under `/memories`; tool `memory_20250818`. Verbatim security guidance: "add validation that strips sensitive data before your handler writes the file"; "Periodically delete memory files that haven't been accessed in a long time" (expiry); path-traversal protection required. Injected prompt: "ASSUME INTERRUPTION: Your context window might be reset at any moment, so you risk losing any progress that is not recorded in your memory directory"; pairs with compaction to "preserve the information that must survive summarization." Basis for the memory write-validation + expiry checks. |
| Cognition — Don't Build Multi-Agents | https://cognition.com/blog/dont-build-multi-agents | By Walden Yan, dated 2025-06-12 on the page. Verbatim: "Share context, and share full agent traces, not just individual messages"; parallel subagents that "cannot see what the other was doing … end up being inconsistent." Basis for "handoff carries the full trace, not just the latest message." |
| langchain-ai/deepagents #1698 | https://github.com/langchain-ai/deepagents/issues/1698 | Filed issue (open, labeled a bug); issue date not separately confirmed on this fetch. Title verbatim: "`SubAgentMiddleware` does not propagate `recursion_limit` to subagent graphs — subagents silently use default limit of 25" (root cause: `ainvoke` called without a `config`). Basis for the "bound the tree, not just the call — propagate the cap to spawned sub-agents" clause under LLM06. |

CIA *Studies in Intelligence*, Vol. 8 No. 4 (1964); released via CIA Historical Review Program 1993. Confirmed thesis: undefined verbal-probability terms are read inconsistently — Kent's own Board of National Estimates read "serious possibility" (NIE 29-51) anywhere from 20:80 to 80:20 odds; the subtitle states "the case for consistent, unambiguous usage of a few key odds expressions."

## Verified by direct fetch (2026-09-18) — mutation testing

Verification date for the rows below: **2026-09-18**. Added for the deep-code-review
`testing-and-evals.md` mutation-testing lens (measuring the product suite's
fault-detection, not only line coverage).

| Standard / tool | URL | What was confirmed |
|---|---|---|
| PIT (pitest) — mutation testing | https://pitest.org/ | "Traditional test coverage (i.e line, statement, branch, etc.) measures only which code is executed by your tests. It does not check that your tests are actually able to detect faults in the executed code"; "The quality of your tests can be gauged from the percentage of mutations killed."

| Stryker Mutator — configuration (`thresholds.break`) | https://stryker-mutator.io/docs/stryker-js/configuration/ | The `thresholds` config exposes `break`: "mutation score < break: Error! Stryker will exit with exit code 1, indicating a build failure." Cited as the available CI-gate operator (exit non-zero below a set score). **`break` defaults to `null` — "Set `break` to `null` (default) to never let your build fail" — so it gates only once explicitly set** (`high`/`low` default 80/60 and only colour the report). No specific threshold value is endorsed — treat the number as per-repo. Stryker is the JS/TS engine. |

## Verified by direct fetch (2026-09-20) — algorithmic-complexity / resource-exhaustion DoS

Verification date for the rows below: **2026-09-20**. Added for the deep-code-review
`language-stack-redflags.md` "Denial of service / resource amplification" section
(hash-flooding, uncontrolled recursion, and excessive-size-value allocation
bullets). All three pages are CWE version **4.20** (from each page heading; the
`<title>` element additionally carries a "CWE - " prefix omitted in the quotes
below). Mitigation shapes named in the skill text for CWE-407 and library

| CWE-407 — Inefficient Algorithmic Complexity | https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/407.html | Title (page heading) verbatim: "CWE-407: Inefficient Algorithmic Complexity (4.20)". Description, verbatim: "An algorithm in a product has an inefficient worst-case computational complexity that may be detrimental to system performance and can be triggered by an attacker, typically using crafted manipulations that ensure that the worst case is being reached." Observed Examples, verbatim: CVE-2003-0244 and CVE-2003-0364 both "CPU consumption via inputs that cause many hash table collisions." Fetched + verified 2026-09-20. |

| CWE-789 — Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value | https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/789.html | Title (page heading) verbatim: "CWE-789: Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value (4.20)". Description, verbatim: "The product allocates memory based on an untrusted, large size value, but it does not ensure that the size is within expected limits, allowing arbitrary amounts of memory to be allocated." Observed Examples, verbatim: CVE-2023-2253 "Query capability for API endpoint allows a large value for number of records to return, leading to allocation of a large array"; CVE-2008-1708 "memory consumption and daemon exit by specifying a large value in a length field."

| Google AIP-158 — Pagination | https://google.aip.dev/158 | Under "Opacity," verbatim: "Page tokens provided by APIs must be opaque (but URL-safe) strings, and must not be user-parseable. This is because if users are able to deconstruct these, they will do so. This effectively makes the implementation details of your API's pagination become part of the API surface, and it becomes impossible to update those details without breaking users." Verbatim warning: "Base-64 encoding an otherwise-transparent page token is not a sufficient obfuscation mechanism."

LIMIT and OFFSET"); three other `postgresql.org/docs/current/...` pages are already indexed above (transaction-iso.html, sql-createindex.html, explicit-locking.html), same version-floating-alias citation practice. Verbatim: "When using LIMIT, it is important to use an ORDER BY clause that constrains the result rows into a unique order. Otherwise you will get an unpredictable subset of the query's rows." Verbatim: "The query optimizer takes LIMIT into account when generating query plans, so you are very likely to get different plans (yielding different row orders) depending on what you give for LIMIT and OFFSET. Thus, using different LIMIT/OFFSET values to select different subsets of a query result will give inconsistent results unless you enforce a predictable result ordering with ORDER BY. This is not a bug; it is an inherent consequence of the fact that SQL does not promise to deliver the results of a query in any particular order unless ORDER BY is used to constrain the order."

Worked example, verbatim: injecting `<a id=config><a id=config name=url href='malicious.js'>` against code reading `window.config.url`, "to load additional JavaScript code, and obtain arbitrary client-side code execution." Sanitizer defaults, verbatim: DOMPurify's default `SANITIZE_DOM` "removes all clobbering collisions with built-in APIs and properties" only — custom/app-defined names need `SANITIZE_NAMED_PROPS: true` (isolates the namespace "by prefixing them with `user-content-` string"); the Sanitizer API "does not prevent DOM Clobbering [in] its default setting" and needs `blockAttributes` set on `id`/`name` (source page's own wording has a minor typo — "it its" for "in its" — reproduced faithfully, not an error introduced here). Also verbatim: CSP "can only mitigate some variants of DOM clobbering attacks ... but not when already-present code can be abused for code execution, e.g., clobbering the parameters of code evaluation constructs like eval()."

`Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy` trio; the A07 authentication-failures section gaining
push-notification MFA fatigue (push-bombing) and OTP handling-and-storage discipline; and
the A01 access-control section gaining transaction authorization (What-You-See-Is-What-
You-Sign plus a transaction-unique authorization credential) as an axis distinct from the

`curl -sL` (raw HTML), not a summarizer.

| Standard / source | URL | What was confirmed |
|---|---|---|
| OWASP HTTP Headers Cheat Sheet | https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/HTTP_Headers_Cheat_Sheet.html | Verbatim, Permissions-Policy: "Permissions-Policy allows you to control which origins can use which browser features, both in the top-level page and in embedded frames. … This means that you can configure your site to never allow the camera or microphone to be activated. This prevents that an injection, for example an XSS, enables the camera, the microphone, or other browser feature." Example given: `Permissions-Policy: geolocation=(), camera=(), microphone=()`. Verbatim, COOP: "The HTTP Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy (COOP) response header allows you to ensure a top-level document does not share a browsing context group with cross-origin documents." Example: `Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy: same-origin`. Verbatim, COEP: "The HTTP Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy (COEP) response header prevents a document from loading any cross-origin resources that don't explicitly grant the document permission (using CORP or CORS)." Example: `Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy: require-corp`. Verbatim, CORP: "The Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy (CORP) header allows you to control the set of origins that are empowered to include a resource. It is a robust defense against attacks like Spectre, as it allows browsers to block a given response before it enters an attacker's process." Example: `Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy: same-site`. Fetched + verified 2026-09-20. |
| OWASP XS Leaks Cheat Sheet | https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/XS_Leaks_Cheat_Sheet.html | Cited as the second source for the same header fold (COOP/CORP), not a separate fold. Frame-counting attacks § Defense, COOP, verbatim: "Setting this header will prevent cross-origin documents from opening in the same browsing context group. This solution ensures that document A opening another document will not have access to the window object." — the cross-window/window-reference leak. Attacks based on error events § Defense lists three mitigations in order — SubResource protection (unique tokens), Fetch metadata (`Sec-Fetch-Site`), and CORP, verbatim: "If the server returns this header with the appropriate value, the browser will not load resources from our site or origin (even static images) in another application." — the `onload`/`onerror` resource-probing leak; CORP is one of three listed defenses there, not singled out as primary. Quick recommendations, verbatim: "If your application uses cookies, make sure to set the appropriate SameSite attribute," "consider using the mechanisms described in the framing protection section" (frame-ancestors / legacy X-Frame-Options), "To strengthen the isolation of your application between other origins, use Cross Origin Resource Policy and Cross Origin Opener Policy headers with appropriate values," and "Use the headers available within Fetch Metadata to build your own resource isolation policy" — four siblings, not two; this skill already covers the first two (SameSite, framing protection), COOP/CORP is the fold, and Fetch Metadata is out of scope for this fold (not claimed as covered). SameSite verbatim, defense-in-depth caveat: "SameSite cookies are a strong defense-in-depth mechanism against some classes of XS Leaks and CSRF attacks, which can significantly reduce the attack surface, but may not completely cut them." Fetched + verified 2026-09-20. |
| OWASP Multifactor Authentication Cheat Sheet | https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Multifactor_Authentication_Cheat_Sheet.html | MFA Fatigue (Push Notification Bombing), verbatim: "Attackers repeatedly send MFA push notifications, often combined with social engineering, hoping the user eventually approves one." Mitigations, verbatim: "Require challenge-response push authentication (for example, number matching) to prevent blind approval of authentication requests," "Rate-limit or cap push notifications to prevent repeated prompt abuse," "Monitor for anomalous authentication activity, such as multiple push prompts in a short period or new-device token reuse." One-Time Password (OTP) Handling and Storage, verbatim: "At a minimum, OTP implementations SHOULD: Enforce a short time-to-live (TTL); Ensure OTPs are single use; Apply strict attempt limits; Invalidate the OTP on successful verification," and "OTP implementations SHOULD NOT: Log OTP values; Store OTPs in long-term plaintext form." Fetched + verified 2026-09-20. |
| OWASP Transaction Authorization Cheat Sheet | https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Transaction_Authorization_Cheat_Sheet.html | §1.1, verbatim (What You See Is What You Sign): "When the developer builds components for transaction authorizations, they should use the What You See Is What You Sign principle. An authorization method must permit a user to identify and acknowledge the data that is significant to a given transaction. For example, in the case of a wire transfer, the user should be able to identify the target account and amount." §1.5 title and body, verbatim: "Each transaction should be authorized using unique authorization credentials" — "If applications only ask for transaction authorization credentials once (such as a static password, code sent through SMS, or a token response), the user could authorize any transaction during the entire session or reuse the same credentials when they need to authorize a transaction. In this scenario, attackers can employ malware to sniff credentials and use them to authorize any transaction without the user's knowledge." Note: this cheat sheet does **not** use the phrase "time-bound" anywhere (grepped this session) — the sourced requirement is per-transaction **uniqueness**, cited as such in the skill body. This section is explicitly framed (§1.4) as orthogonal to using a distinct approving principal — it does not mention maker-checker/segregation of duties at all; that framing is this skill's own synthesis, not sourced from this page.

## Verified by direct fetch (2026-09-20) — lint/scanner rule-tier verification (typescript-eslint, CodeQL, ruff)

Verification date for the rows below: **2026-09-20**. Added for the deep-code-review
`method.md` Phase-1 planted-defect-matrix fold: a gate can be present, non-empty,
correctly path-scoped, and not excluding the changed path — the matrix's existing
(a)-(d) checks — while still running only a narrower rule/query category that
structurally cannot catch a defect class the review otherwise cares about. All
fetched via `curl` (raw HTML), not a summarizer. The first row below supersedes an
initial read of typescript-eslint's coarser per-rule index column (which tags a rule
only "recommended" or "strict," omitting the "-type-checked" suffix); each rule's
own page states its exact enabling config and was fetched to confirm it precisely.

| Standard / source | URL | What was confirmed |
|---|---|---|
| typescript-eslint — per-rule config pages (4) | https://typescript-eslint.io/rules/no-unnecessary-condition/ · https://typescript-eslint.io/rules/no-floating-promises/ · https://typescript-eslint.io/rules/no-misused-promises/ · https://typescript-eslint.io/rules/unbound-method/ | Each rule's own page states, verbatim, which single config "enables this rule." Confirmed: `no-floating-promises`, `no-misused-promises`, and `unbound-method` are each enabled by extending `recommended-type-checked`; `no-unnecessary-condition` requires the further `strict-type-checked` — one config beyond it. (The coarser per-rule index table at https://typescript-eslint.io/rules/ tags these only "recommended" / "strict" in its config-group column, omitting the "-type-checked" suffix — the per-rule page, not that column, is the precise source cited here.) A project already on `recommended-type-checked` — type-aware, catching the promise/unbound-method class — can still be structurally blind to a `no-unnecessary-condition`-class defect. Fetched + verified 2026-09-20. |

Fetched + verified 2026-09-20. |
| CodeQL query help — suite index | https://codeql.github.com/codeql-query-help/ | Verbatim: "View the query help for the queries included in the `default`, `security-extended`, and `security-and-quality` query suites for the languages supported by CodeQL." Confirms three distinct, named query suites — which one a CodeQL workflow actually runs is a materially different query surface, not a formality. Fetched + verified 2026-09-20. |
| ruff — the `select` setting | https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/settings/#lint_select | Verbatim: "A list of rule codes or prefixes to enable... **Default value**: See Default Rules." The worked `extend-select` example's own comment, verbatim: "On top of the defaults, enable flake8-bugbear (`B`) and flake8-quotes (`Q`)." Confirms ruff ships a documented default rule selection, distinct from and smaller than what `select`/`extend-select` can add; this skill does not pin exact rule counts on either side, since they drift across ruff releases.

## Verified by direct fetch (2026-09-20) — switch/case fallthrough & unreachable-code linter rules

Verification date for the rows below: **2026-09-20**. Added for the deep-code-review
`language-stack-redflags.md` switch/case control-flow fold (cross-language fallthrough
reversal, unreachable-after-return, lexical declarations leaking across case clauses,
duplicate/mislabeled case). All fetched via `curl -sL` (raw HTML/Markdown), not a
summarizer. Two corrections to the working brief surfaced by these fetches: (1) C# was
initially assumed to share the C/Java/JS default-fallthrough behavior — Microsoft's own
reference states the opposite, that implicit fallthrough is a **compiler error** in C#;
(2) Java is not uniformly a default-fallthrough language — Oracle's docs confirm its
modern arrow-form `case L ->` switch does not fall through, only the classic colon form
does. Both corrections are reflected in the skill content, not just here.

Otherwise control flows to the end of the `switch` statement." Confirms Go cases stop by default; fallthrough is opt-in only. Fetched + verified 2026-09-20. |
| The Rust Reference — Match expressions | https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/expressions/match-expr.html | Verbatim: "The first arm with a matching pattern is chosen as the branch target of the match, any variables bound by the pattern are assigned to local variables in the arm's block, and control enters the block."

And: "Every switch section must end with a break, goto, or return. Falling through from one switch section to the next generates a compiler error."

Set state to special authority ignore slashes state." — and in the *special authority ignore slashes state* a backslash is likewise consumed identically to a forward slash — verbatim: "If c is neither U+002F (/) nor U+005C (\), then set state to authority state and decrease pointer by 1." The backslash is flagged only as an `invalid-reverse-solidus` validation error, defined verbatim: "The URL has a special scheme and it uses U+005C (\) instead of U+002F (/)." (example given: "https://example.org\path\to\file"). A validation error is non-fatal — verbatim: "A validation error does not mean that the parser terminates. Termination of a parser is always stated explicitly, e.g., through a return statement." — so the parse continues and the backslash still acts as a slash. Confirmed against the raw spec HTML; reproduced with `new URL('/\\host', 'https://good.example/page').host` returning `'host'` (also for `\/host` and `\\host`). Fetched + verified 2026-09-21. |

## Verified by direct fetch (2026-09-21) — OWASP MASVS/MASTG (mobile appsec)

Verification date for the rows below: **2026-09-21**. Added for the new mobile
archetype and `deep-code-review` `references/mobile-appsec.md` (iOS / Android /
native mobile app security), grounded in the OWASP Mobile Application Security
project.

| Standard / source | URL | What was confirmed |
|---|---|---|
| OWASP MASVS — Mobile Application Security Verification Standard (control groups) | https://mas.owasp.org/MASVS/ | **Eight** control groups, confirmed from the mas.owasp.org/MASVS/ index (HTTP 200 this session): **MASVS-STORAGE** (Storage), **MASVS-CRYPTO** (Cryptography), **MASVS-AUTH** (Authentication and Authorization), **MASVS-NETWORK** (Network Communication), **MASVS-PLATFORM** (Platform Interaction), **MASVS-CODE** (Code Quality), **MASVS-RESILIENCE** (Resilience Against Reverse Engineering and Tampering), **MASVS-PRIVACY** (Privacy). Individual control text quoted in `mobile-appsec.md` is verbatim from the `OWASP/masvs` repo at pinned commit `6df8fc412628f0b24792d5baed29bf7dccdf2942` (`controls/MASVS-*.md`), e.g. STORAGE-1 "The app securely stores sensitive data.", STORAGE-2 "The app prevents leakage of sensitive data.", NETWORK-1 "The app secures all network traffic according to the current best practices.", NETWORK-2 "The app performs identity pinning for all remote endpoints under the developer's control.", PLATFORM-1 "The app uses IPC mechanisms securely.", PLATFORM-2 "The app uses WebViews securely.", PLATFORM-3 "The app uses the user interface securely.", AUTH-2 "The app performs local authentication securely according to the platform best practices.", RESILIENCE-1 "The app validates the integrity of the platform.", CRYPTO-1 "The app employs current strong cryptography and uses it according to industry best practices.", CRYPTO-2 "The app performs key management according to industry best practices.", PRIVACY-2 "The app prevents identification of the user." **Version:** v2.1.0 per the `OWASP/masvs` GitHub `releases/latest` (tag `v2.1.0`, published 2024-01-18); the mas.owasp.org/MASVS/ page fetched this session did **not** display a version string — the version is sourced from the GitHub release, not the fetched page. Fetched + verified 2026-09-21. |
| OWASP MASTG — Mobile Application Security Testing Guide | https://mas.owasp.org/MASTG/ | The testing companion to MASVS (HTTP 200 this session): per-platform (Android / iOS) tests, a knowledge base, best practices, and vulnerable/secure demos, organized around the same eight MASVS control groups; it provides the how-to-test procedures for the controls MASVS defines. **Version:** v2.0.0 per the `OWASP/owasp-mastg` GitHub `releases/latest` (tag `v2.0.0`, published 2026-06-30); the mas.owasp.org/MASTG/ page fetched this session did **not** display a version string. Cited by name (with URL) as the testing companion; no specific MASTG test IDs are quoted in `mobile-appsec.md`. Fetched + verified 2026-09-21. |

## Verified by direct fetch (2026-09-21) — ARIA APG Combobox Pattern

Verification date for the row below: **2026-09-21**. Added for the deep-code-review
`frontend-a11y.md` combobox-popup focus-exit-dismiss fold; complements the general
ARIA APG row above.

| Standard | URL | What was confirmed |
|---|---|---|
| W3C ARIA Authoring Practices Guide (APG) — Combobox Pattern | https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/combobox/ | Keyboard Interaction section. Confirmed verbatim: "Tab: The combobox is in the page `Tab` sequence."; that "the popup indicator icon or button (if present), the popup, and the popup descendants are excluded from the page `Tab` sequence"; and that the only listed popup-dismiss key is "Escape: Dismisses the popup if it is visible." Basis for the `frontend-a11y.md` fold that a combobox/listbox is a single tab stop with a non-tabbable popup, so keyboard focus leaving the widget is a dismiss path separate from Escape and outside-click that must itself close the popup (else the popup is left open while focus sits on a later control — a WCAG 2.4.3 Focus Order break). The APG text does not itself state "Tab closes the popup"; the fold rests on the exclusion-from-tab-sequence fact plus the Focus Order consequence, not on an APG mandate. |

## Verified by direct fetch (2026-09-21) — WCAG bypass blocks & info-and-relationships

Sourced for the `frontend-a11y.md` folds that (a) correct landmarks satisfy the automated bypass-blocks check yet a sighted keyboard-only user still needs a real skip link, and (b) a tree conveying depth only via padding + colour hides its hierarchy from assistive tech.

| Standard / source | URL | What was confirmed |
|---|---|---|
| WCAG 2.2 SC 2.4.1 Bypass Blocks | https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/bypass-blocks.html | Level A. SC text verbatim: "A mechanism is available to bypass blocks of content that are repeated on multiple web pages." Its sufficient techniques are independent options, any one of which meets the SC: **ARIA11** (using ARIA landmarks to identify regions of a page), **G1** (adding a link at the top of each page that goes directly to the main content area), and **H69** (providing heading elements at the beginning of each section of content). Basis for the fold that correct landmarks (ARIA11) alone pass the automated bypass check while a sighted keyboard-only user, for whom landmarks are not perceivable, still needs a skip link (G1). Fetched + verified 2026-09-21. |
| WCAG 2.2 SC 1.3.1 Info and Relationships | https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/info-and-relationships.html | Level A. SC text verbatim: "Information, structure, and relationships conveyed through presentation can be programmatically determined or are available in text." The Understanding page gives hierarchical organization shown by *indented* list items as an example of structure that must be made programmatically determinable or available in text. Basis for the fold that a tree/nav conveying parent-child depth only through left-padding and a colour accent fails 1.3.1 (with the colour accent additionally implicating 1.4.1 Use of Color).

## Verified by direct fetch (2026-09-21) — POSIX RE bracket-expression range locale-dependence

Sourced for the `language-stack-redflags.md` Shell/Bash fold that a bracket *range* used to validate a character class (`case`/`[[ =~ ]]`/`grep`) is matched against the locale's collating sequence, so a range-based validation gate returns a different verdict under a different `LC_COLLATE` (fix: pin `LC_ALL=C` or use an explicit character set).

| Standard / source | URL | What was confirmed |
|---|---|---|
| POSIX (The Open Group Base Specifications Issue 7, 2018) — RE Bracket Expression | https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/basedefs/V1_chap09.html | §9.3.5 RE Bracket Expression, range expressions. Verbatim: "In the POSIX locale, a range expression represents the set of collating elements that fall between two elements in the collation sequence, inclusive"; and "in other locales, a range expression has unspecified behavior." Confirms a bracket-range match set is defined by `LC_COLLATE` (the locale's collating sequence), not by codepoint, and is unspecified outside the POSIX/C locale — the basis for treating a shell range used in a validation gate (`*[!0-9a-f]*`, `[[ =~ ^[0-9a-f]+$ ]]`, `grep '[0-9a-f]'`) as locale-dependent and pinning `LC_ALL=C` or using an explicit set. The glibc dictionary-collation manifestation (case-interleaved ranges) is the well-known concrete case, not quoted from this page; the GNU grep manual was not reachable this session and is not cited.

## Verified by direct fetch (2026-09-23) — Claude Code hooks (SubagentStop)

Sourced for `agentic-delivery/scripts/handback_cap.py` and the handback-cap section of
`agentic-delivery/references/host-enforcement.md`.

| Standard / source | URL | What was confirmed |
|---|---|---|
| Claude Code — Hooks reference | https://code.claude.com/docs/en/hooks | "Exit code 2 behavior per event" table, `SubagentStop` row verbatim: can block — "Prevents the subagent from stopping, continues the subagent". `SubagentStop` "Fires when a subagent finishes"; hooks needing the final text "should use `last_assistant_message` on Stop and SubagentStop instead of reading the transcript". Inside a subagent the input also carries `agent_id` ("Unique identifier for the subagent") and `agent_type` ("Agent name (for example, `"Explore"` or `"security-reviewer"`)"). Matcher table: the `SubagentStop` matcher filters on **agent type**, same values as `SubagentStart` (`general-purpose`, `Explore`, `Plan`, custom agent names). Fetched + verified 2026-09-23. |

## Verified by direct fetch (2026-09-23) — token/cost levers: model-scoped cache, subagent model pin, context editing, batch discount

Sourced for `deep-code-review/references/model-tiering.md`'s tightened prompt-caching/
batch levers and `agentic-delivery/references/host-enforcement.md`'s new subagent
model + cache-TTL pin section. Re-verifies and sharpens two URLs already indexed
above (2026-09-08, 2026-09-13) with the exact multipliers/thresholds now cited by
name in the skill text; each row fetched this session.

| Standard / source | URL | What was confirmed |
|---|---|---|
| Claude Code — How Claude Code uses prompt caching | https://code.claude.com/docs/en/prompt-caching | Verbatim, "Switching models": "Each model has its own cache. Switching with `/model` means the next request reads the entire conversation history with no cache hits, even though the content is identical." Verbatim, "Subagents and the cache": a subagent "starts its own conversation with its own system prompt and tool set, separate from the parent's. Its first request doesn't read the parent's cache, because the two prefixes differ, and it warms a cache of its own across its turns. Subagents fall outside the main-conversation TTL bucket, so they get five minutes even on a subscription until you choose a longer one." "Choose the TTL yourself": main conversation via the `promptCacheTtl` setting or `CLAUDE_CODE_PROMPT_CACHE_TTL` env var; every other request via the `subagentPromptCacheTtl` setting or `CLAUDE_CODE_SUBAGENT_PROMPT_CACHE_TTL` env var (both require Claude Code v2.1.242+); `FORCE_PROMPT_CACHING_5M=1` forces five minutes for both buckets and wins over either. Re-fetched 2026-09-23 (markdown endpoint, https://code.claude.com/docs/en/prompt-caching.md) for the effort and TTL-precedence detail. Verbatim, "Changing effort level": "On most models, changing the effort level mid-session means the next request reads the entire conversation history with no cache hits"; "On Opus 5.5 and Fable 5.1 with an API key or a Claude subscription, changing effort keeps the cache... This doesn't apply on Amazon Bedrock, Google Cloud's Agent Platform, or a Claude apps gateway, or when you set `CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_EXPERIMENTAL_BETAS` or your organization has a HIPAA configuration." "Which TTL each request gets" table: Claude subscription within plan usage — main conversation one hour, everything else five minutes "except the server-controlled helper requests, which get one hour"; usage credits, API key, or cloud provider — five minutes for both. "When more than one control applies, Claude Code takes the first match in this order": 1. `FORCE_PROMPT_CACHING_5M=1`; 2. the bucket's environment variable; 3. the bucket's setting; 4. for a subagent's requests, the `cacheTtl` value in its `experimental` frontmatter (v2.1.248+; "ignores a `1h` there while your Claude subscription is using usage credits"); 5. `ENABLE_PROMPT_CACHING_1H=1`, "which requests one hour for both buckets"; 6. the bucket default.

| Claude Code — Subagents | https://code.claude.com/docs/en/sub-agents | Re-verified for new facts beyond the 2026-09-08 row above (same URL). Verbatim: "To apply one model to every subagent, teammate, and workflow agent, also set `CLAUDE_CODE_SUBAGENT_MODEL_FORCE` to `1`. Requires Claude Code v2.1.257 or later." "If you set both variables, subagents run on the model in `CLAUDE_CODE_SUBAGENT_MODEL`. If you set only `CLAUDE_CODE_SUBAGENT_MODEL_FORCE`, subagents run on the main conversation's model." A subagent's own frontmatter can set `experimental.cacheTtl: 5m\|1h` to choose its own cache lifetime (requires v2.1.248+) — a per-agent opt-in, distinct from the two host-level settings above. Re-fetched 2026-09-23 (markdown endpoint, https://code.claude.com/docs/en/sub-agents.md) for the pin's exceptions. Verbatim: "While `CLAUDE_CODE_SUBAGENT_MODEL_FORCE` is on, Claude Code ignores the `model` field of every subagent definition, including the built-in Explore and Plan subagents, and Claude can't pass a model when it starts a subagent. Two kinds of subagent still run on the main conversation's model: A fork [;] A skill that runs in a subagent with `model: inherit`"; "When you set only `CLAUDE_CODE_SUBAGENT_MODEL_FORCE`, the built-in Explore subagent keeps its model cap" (Explore: "inherits from the main conversation, capped at Opus on the Claude API").

| Claude docs — Prompt caching (pricing detail) | https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/prompt-caching | Re-verified for the exact multipliers beyond the 2026-09-08 row above (same URL). Verbatim: "5-minute cache write tokens are 1.25 times the base input tokens price[;] 1-hour cache write tokens are 2 times the base input tokens price[;] Cache read tokens are 0.1 times the base input tokens price (see the table footnote for per-model exceptions)... These multipliers stack with other pricing modifiers such as the Batch API discount and data residency." Per-model read-price exceptions: 0.05x base input on Claude Opus 5.5, 0.025x on Claude Fable 5.1 and Claude Mythos 5.1. Minimum cacheable-prompt sizes (shorter prompts "cannot be cached, even if marked with `cache_control`... processed without caching, and no error is returned"): 512 tokens (Fable 5.1, Mythos 5.1, Opus 5.5, Opus 5, Fable 5, Mythos 5), 1,024 tokens (Opus 4.8, Sonnet 5, Sonnet 4.6, Sonnet 4.5), 2,048 tokens (Mythos Preview, Opus 4.7, Haiku 3.5), 4,096 tokens (Opus 4.6, Opus 4.5, Haiku 4.5).

| Claude docs — Context editing | https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/context-editing | Re-verified for the exact defaults beyond the 2026-09-13 row above (same URL). The `clear_tool_uses_20250919` strategy's configuration options, verbatim defaults: `trigger` = 100,000 input tokens ("Once the prompt exceeds this threshold, clearing begins"); `keep` = 3 tool uses ("The API removes the oldest tool interactions first, preserving the most recent ones"); `clear_at_least` = none, "Ensures a minimum number of tokens is cleared each time the strategy activates... helps determine if context clearing is worth breaking your prompt cache"; `exclude_tools` = none, "List of tool names whose tool uses and results should never be cleared." Verbatim on the caching interaction: "Tool result clearing: Invalidates cached prompt prefixes when content is cleared. To account for this, clear enough tokens to make the cache invalidation worthwhile... You'll incur cache write costs each time content is cleared, but subsequent requests can reuse the newly cached prefix." Fetched + verified 2026-09-23. |
| Claude docs — Batch processing | https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/batch-processing | Re-verified for the exact discount beyond the 2026-09-08 row above (same URL). Verbatim: "cutting costs by 50%"; "most batches finishing in less than 1 hour while reducing costs by 50% and increasing throughput." On stacking with prompt caching, verbatim: "The pricing discounts from prompt caching and Message Batches can stack, providing even greater cost savings when both features are used together." (Batch cache-hit rates are best-effort, "typically... ranging from 30% to 98%, depending on... traffic patterns" — not a guaranteed hit rate.) Fetched + verified 2026-09-23. |
