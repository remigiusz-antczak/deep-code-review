# skill-drift-check.sh — warn when the machine-installed deep-code-review skill
# has drifted from the public repository's main-branch VERSION.
#
# Compares two VERSION strings:
#   installed : ~/.claude/skills/deep-code-review/VERSION
#               (override with DCR_INSTALLED_VERSION_FILE)
#   upstream  : .claude/skills/deep-code-review/VERSION on
#               github.com/remigiusz-antczak/deep-code-review @ main
#               (read via the gh CLI; override the repo with DCR_REPO)
#
# Exit codes:
#   0  OK    — versions match.
#   0  SKIP  — no comparison is possible, so the guard stays out of the way and
#              never hard-fails its caller. Skipped cases: gh CLI absent, gh not
#              authenticated, network/API failure, empty upstream response, or
#              the skill not installed locally. Each prints a one-line reason.
#   1  DRIFT — both versions were read and they differ (the only failing case).
#   2  usage error.
#
# Design note: exit 1 fires ONLY on a genuine installed-vs-upstream mismatch.
# Every missing precondition skips (exit 0) rather than reporting false drift, so
# the script is safe to drop into any context (local shell, a warn-only hook, a
# make target) without spurious failures.
#
# This script is intentionally NOT wired into any git hook, CI job, or cron.
# It performs no writes and needs no sudo; its only side effect is one read-only
# HTTPS GET to the GitHub API (through gh).

set -uo pipefail   # deliberately NOT -e: every failure is handled explicitly.
